"The episode begins in the Candy Kingdom, Jake is playfully chasing Lady Rainicorn."
"Jake says Yeah, you think you're pretty way up there but I can get you! he stretches to be on Lady's level."
"Lady Rainicorn says 나 잡아봐봐~ ""Catch me if you can."""
Finn and Princess Bubblegum are in a cemetery with a table full of different chemicals.
Princess Bubblegum says Alright. Let me just add three more drops of explosive diarrhea.
She adds the explosive diarrhea and a giant cloud shaped like a skull puffs out. Not a good omen.
Finn and Princess Bubblegum says Oooo...
"Finn says Hey Princess Bubblegum, when we bring the dead back to life, will it be filled with worms?"
"Princess Bubblegum says No. If my decorpsinator serum works, all the dead Candy People will look as young and healthy as you do."
"Finn does a ""Tarzan-yell"" while hitting his hands against his chest."
"Princess Bubblegum says Pick up that platter, tough guy."
"Finn picks up a serving platter and open the lid, revealing a Candy Person corpse."
Finn says Old Mr. Cream Puff?
Princess Bubblegum says Giggles We used to date. Applies the serum.
Mr. Cream Puff's corpse starts to glow and overflow with the fizzing serum.
"Finn says Something's happening! Come on, come on..."
Princess Bubblegum says Work.
A zombie Mr. Cream Puff arises and moans.
Finn says Algebraic!
"Princess Bubblegum says Wait, something's wrong."
Zombie Mr. Cream Puff says Sugar! Squirts serum out of his eyes and mouth
Finn and Princess Bubblegum says Ew!
Zombie Mr. Cream Puff leaps into a giant test tube. The test tube falls and infects the whole cemetery. Zombie Candy People begin to arise from their graves.
"Finn says Hey, look, the decorpsinator serum is working!"
"Princess Bubblegum says No, this is wrong. They're not coming back to life--they're still dead! The decorpsinator serum--it's incomplete! she rubs the head of a candy person that looks like a love heart."
Zombie Love Heart says lashing out at Princess Bubblegum Rah. Must eat sugar!
"Finn says Pushes him back down You're grounded, Mister."
"Princess Bubblegum says Oh, this is really bad. They're going to be attracted to the Candy Kingdom!"
Finn says Why?
"Princess Bubblegum says Because the Candy People are made of sugar, ya ding dong!"
"Zombie Mr. Cream Puff says On Princess Bubblegum Gimme some sugar, baby."
Finn says Chew on this! Kicks him
"Princess Bubblegum says Giggles Good one, Finn. Quickly, to the kingdom!"
They run out of the cemetery
Finn says Kicks another zombie Get a life!
"Princess Bubblegum is at the top of her castle, ringing a large bell"
"Princess Bubblegum says All citizens of the Candy Kingdom! Report to the palace, immediately!"
Candy People mumble in confusion and walk to the palace
Jake says Whoa!
Jake and Lady go off to the palace. Princess Bubblegum notices the zombies slowly leaving the cemetery.
"Princess Bubblegum says worried Hurry, sweet citizens."
"Finn says Alright, you heard the princess, everyone in! Alright, no pushing, come on!"
"Jake says Dude, what's up?"
"Finn says The princess will explain everything. Tree Trunks, get those hot buns in here, girl."
"Tree Trunks says Carrying hot cross buns Oh, I hope it's not bad news."
Princess Bubblegum and Finn close the door
Finn says Did we get everyone?
Manfried says All present and accounted for.
"Finn says Thanks, Manfried."
Manfried says You're welcome.
"Princess Bubblegum says Citizens, we are assembled here in the candy foyer for a momentous announcement. Tonight we are all going to have... a slumber party!"
Finn says What?!
Crowd cheers
Finn says Wait! What about the zom--?! Princess Bubblegum covers his mouth
Princess Bubblegum says Go ahead and start partying.
"Finn says Voice muffled But, Princess, the Undead--"
"Princess Bubblegum says Carries Finn to the lab We'll be right back, everyone."
Jake says Whooo!
In the lab
"Princess Bubblegum says Finn, the Candy People can't know about the zombies."
Finn says Wha?!
"Princess Bubblegum says If they knew, they would flip out."
"Finn says What do you mean ""flip out""?"
Princess Bubblegum says I mean they would flip out.
Scene changes to the cemetery; Starchy arrives with a shovel.
"Starchy says Princess? It's me, Starchy the gravedigger. I brought you a larger corpse shovel. Oh, Princess? Well, I'll just wait for you here, then. By the mausoleum. With my back turned. And my defenses lowered."
"As Starchy does so, Candy Zombie comes out of the mausoleum and goes up to Starchy, Starchy starts to scream and gasp and then... KABOOM!!! He explodes in a flash of light. Back at the castle."
Finn says Candy People explode when they get scared?!
"Princess Bubblegum says Not telling the Candy People about the zombies is so important that you need to promise, Royal Promise, not to let anyone find out about the zombies, ever."
"Finn says Okay, sure."
"Princess Bubblegum says No, Finn. You have to Royal Promise."
"Finn says Yes, kneels I Royal Promise."
Princess Bubblegum says Now I must cloister myself in the lab and finish the equation to my decorpsinator serum. You keep the candy folk distracted and ignorant. Can you do that?
"Finn says Yes, your highness."
Princess Bubblegum says Good. Don't tell anyone about the zombies. Never ever. She leaves
"Finn says No, wait. Can I at least tell Jake enters Jake?"
"Jake says Tell me about what, dude?"
"Finn says You know, about the outbreak of zom-- Covers his mouth"
"Jake says Chuckles Alright, what's going on?"
"Finn says Uhh, nothing at all, buddy! Laughs awkwardly and skips into the foyer"
"Jake says Hey, dude. I think you and Bubblegum are up to something."
"Finn says nervously Ahha ah, what? No, no way."
"Jake says Whoa, you guys are up to something. Is it some sort of prank? Can I get in on it?"
"Finn says To party-goers Who wants to play ""Truth or Dare""?"
Jake says Hmm...
"Finn says Ok, Chocoberry, you may ask someone to tell a deep truth or a saucy dare."
"Chocoberry says Mr. Cupcake, truth or dare?"
Mr. Cupcake says Dare.
Chocoberry says I dare you to take off your wrapper.
"Everyone goes ""Oooh"""
"Jake says Shoulders Finn Hey seriously, man. I'm your bro. Bros are supposed to tell bros everything all the time. What are you and Bubblegum up to? Is everything alright?"
"Finn says Yep! Fine! Everything is great! Heh, heh. Crinkling sound Except for that. Whoa."
Mr. Cupcake has shed his wrapper
Peppermint Butler says I didn't know he was chocolate.
"Mr. Cupcake says Jake, truth or dare?"
Jake says Truth.
Mr. Cupcake says Do you prefer chocolate or fudge?
"Jake says I can't eat chocolate or fudge 'cause I'm a dog and they'd probably kill me, but hmmmmm probably... neither. Finn! Truth or dare?"
Finn says Dare! Haha!
Jake says I dare you... to tell me the truth about what's going on in your mind. What were you and Bubblegum talking about when you were alone together?
"Everybody goes ""Oooh"""
"Finn says Nervously Umm, ahh, the truth is, ahhh..."
Finn visualizes Princess Bubblegum's face on Jake
"Hallucination of Princess Bubblegum says You promised you wouldn't freakin' tell anyone! Oh, you're so cute, Finn."
Finn says Ahhh... the truth is... that I'd rather play Dodge Socks!
"Finn throws a sock at Jake, Princess Bubblegum's face goes away"
Jake says I'm not playing dodge socks 'til you stop dodging my questions. Hey... Sniffs socks Old Mr. Cream Puff? Isn't he dead?
"Finn says Hey, give me my sock back! Dodge Socks was a bad idea!"
"Jake says Whoa. angrily Look dude, just tell me what's up, 'cause you are crazier than a cannonball tonight."
Finn looks out a window behind Jake and sees the zombies coming
"Finn says Thinking Oh, my goodness! Princess hasn't finished the equation and the zombies are here!"
"Finn says I, uh, she just want this slumber party to be super fun, and if I did have something to tell you, then I would in a second, and it would make my life easier, unless there was something stopping me, like a promise, but there isn't, so I won't, so it's cool."
Zombie arises by the window behind Jake
Zombie says Sugar!
Finn shuts the shutters
Jake says What? You lost me.
"Finn says Umm... Hey, you know what time it is?"
Jake says Adventure time?
"Finn says No, time for Seven Minutes in Heaven! You're first."
Jake says Really?
Finn says Lady Rainicorn! In the closet with Jake!
"Lady says 뭐? 나? 웃겨 정말. 그래, 좋아. 하자. ""What? Me? You gotta be kidding me. Okay, then. I'll play."""
"Jake says Okay, okay, alright. Closet door closes on Jake and Lady But in seven minutes, I'm gonna come out and make you spill your beans, Finn."
Finn says I can't hear you all the way in heaven!
"Finn looks out a window, a horde of zombies shouting ""Sugar"" comes and begins banging on door"
"Chet says Umm, does anyone else hear that?"
"Finn says What? Hear what? I, I don't hear anything."
Candy People begin to murmur as they too hear the banging.
Chet says I hear something I don't understand... and it makes me scared! Begins to shake.
"Finn says What? No, Chet. Everybody, wait. What noise? You mean this noise? Turns on a radio and party lights comes on."
Chet says Oh. Laughs
Finn says Yeah! Dance it! Bust it up! Uh! Uh! Uh! Oh!
"A zombie comes out of the main door, Finn rushes to the door, grabbing a table"
"Chocoberry says What is this game you are playing at now, Finn?"
Finn barricades the door with the table
"Finn says Uhh, it's... Blockado. Haha, the game of barricades. Come on, let's block all the entrances and windows!"
Candy People cheer and begin blockading the doors and windows before the zombies can come in
"Finn says Alright, this is not a permanent solution. Think Finn, how can you keep everyone from finding out?"
"Manfried says Find out about what, Finn?"
"Finn says Manfried, the talking piñata! Your convenient appearance gives me a great idea. Everyone, grab a stick! New game! We're gonna smash some piñatas!"
Manfried says What?
"Finn says Except for you, Manfried."
"Manfried says Oh, thank goodness."
Finn takes some strips off of Taffy Girl
"Finn says Now everybody don these blindfolds. Whispering Thanks, Taffy Girl."
Finn runs into the middle of the blindfolded Candy People swinging sticks
"Finn says Alright, everybody, get together. I'm hanging the piñatas... The zombies burst through the barricades They're all around you. Smash the piñatas!"
Finn and the Candy People smash all the zombies
Finn says Yeah! You guys are on fire!
"Chocoberry smashes a zombie, causing candy to fall out. She kneels down and licks the candy."
"Chocoberry says Oh, it is so tasty."
All the Candy Zombies are smashed and the Candy People are eating their candy
Finn says Yes! We did it! My improbable plan worked!
Jake and Lady come out of the closet
Jake says Whew!
"Lady says 안녕! ""Hello!"""
"Jake says Seven minutes up yet? Grabs a jelly filled doughnut and eats it, noticing the zombie corpses. Whoa! Runs to Finn What the nuts happened here?!"
"Finn says Oh, we killed all the zombies that Princess Bubblegum and I raised from the dead."
Jake says Really!?
"Time freezes, leaving only Finn moving in the room."
Finn says Jake? What's going on?
"Princess Bubblegum enters, unaffected by the freezing."
"Princess Bubblegum says What? Huh? Oh, Finn! Did you break your Royal Promise?"
"Finn says Yeah, but, I mean, all the zombies are dead. The Candy People won't freak out. What's the big deal?"
"Princess Bubblegum says This is really, really bad, Finn. You can't break Royal Promises. Never, ever, never. No matter what, forever."
The room starts shaking
Princess Bubblegum says The Guardians of the Royal Promise are coming for us.
A hand bursts through the ceiling and grabs Finn and Princess Bubblegum and pulls them outside
Finn and Princess Bubblegum says Whoa!
Guardian 1 says Finn the Human. You have broken a Royal Promise for which the penalty is trial by fire.
Guardian 2 breathes fire
Finn says That's stupid.
Princess Bubblegum says Wait! He's my friend! Isn't there another option?!
"Guardian 1 says Yes. Because you care for the promise-breaker, we will give him a less hot trial. You must now answer..."
Guardian 2 says ...Math questions!
Finn says Mathematical!
"Princess Bubblegum says Finn, you're terrible at math."
Finn says Awww.
"Guardian 1 says Now, solve this! Puts Finn in front of Guardian 2, who puts up a hologram of an overly complicated math equation"
Finn says Uhh....
"Guardian 2 says Oh, wait, wait, I thought of a better one. Replaces the equation with one that says ""2+2"""
Guardian 1 says Yes! Two plus two. Solve it or die.
"Finn says Uhh. Four, right?"
Guardians laugh
"Guardian 1 says Oh, correct."
"Guardians heads explode and time rewinds, night becomes day, Guardian 2's head comes back and he talks backwards and goes back to sitting and blowing bubbles around the Candy Kingdom."
"Finn says What's happening, Princess?"
Princess Bubblegum says You've defeated the broken royal promise! The Gumball Guardians are resetting!
"Guardian 1 drops Finn and Princess Bubblegum, who teleport back to Princess Bubblegum's lab"
"Finn says Slamacow! That was tops! Who's not good at math? I was all ""Four!"""
"Princess Bubblegum says Four, four... Four, four, four... That's it! The answer was so simple, I was too smart to see it!"
Finn says You're welcome!
Princess Bubblegum says '4' is the last figure I need to perfect my decorpsinator serum.
"In the foyer, Princess Bubblegum pours the serum on a zombie"
Revived Zombie says Golly!
Finn and Princess Bubblegum pour the serum on all the zombies
Finn says Woohoo! Yeah!
"Jake says This is messed up, but sweet."
"Lady Rainicorn says 진짜로. ""Truly it is."""
Finn and Princess Bubblegum revive more Candy Zombies
Candy Person 1 says Uncle Chewy!
Candy Person 2 says Grandma!
Ice Cream Lady says Former dead relative!
Jake says Starchy!
Starchy says Mornin'.
"Jake says Walks over to Finn Man, you broke a Royal Promise? You're nuts. All you had to do is say that it was a royal secret. I know what's up. Walks away from Finn."
Princess Bubblegum says I hope you grasp the full consequences of breaking promises.
"Finn says Heck yeah! If I break a Royal Promise, I get to fight zombies, throw slumber parties, awake Gumball Guardians and... and..."
"Princess Bubblegum says Alright, alright."
Finn says evilly And reverse death itself!
"Princess Bubblegum says Oh, you are adorable. But keep your promises, okay?"
"Finn says I will, Princess."
Finn notices Starchy gnawing on his leg and picks him up
"Finn says Starchy, you're not a zombie."
Starchy says I can't help it. Flesh is delicious!
Finn says You're delicious!
Starchy says  Don't squeeze me! I'll fart!
"Finn squeezes him, Starchy farts"
"The episode begins at Princess Bubblegum's Mallow Tea Ceremony. She, Finn, Jake, Lumpy Space Princess, and Hot Dog Princess are there."
Finn says  bouncing says Whoop! Huh?
Jake says  bouncing says Whoop!
Lumpy Space Princess says  floating says Whoopiiieee...
"Princess Bubblegum says  Cheers, Lumpy Space Princess."
Everyone cheers.
Jake says  Bouncing!
"Finn says  Princess, this tea party sucks in a big way! But thanks for the invite!"
"Princess Bubblegum says  Oh, don't worry, Finn. The Mallow Tea Ceremony takes years to master."
"Finn says  Princess! I think I just now mastered it! Tea splashes in his face. One more bounce. Bounces down Alright! Hits the ground Unh! Tea partying's hard, huh, Jake?"
Jake says  Hits the ground Oof! Yes!
Lumpy Space Princess says  What?! No way! It's super easy!
"Finn says  Lumpy Space Princess, you big faker! You're floating, not bouncing!"
"Lumpy Space Princess says  Fine. I'll prove it. She stops floating Huh? Ah! Oh, no! Bounces down Oh, snap! She lands with her teeth on Jake's leg."
Jake says  AAAAAGH!
Lumpy Space Princess says  Muffled says Oh. Sorry I bit your leg.
Jake says  You're still biting me!!
"Lumpy Space Princess says  Oh, my gosh. Oh, right. Sorry."
Finn says  Dude! Your leg!
"Jake says  This is... new. It's nothin' ominous, though. Just a bump."
"Lumpy Space Princess says  Nah, that's no bump. It's the early stage of the lumps."
Finn says  Is it serious?
"Lumpy Space Princess says  It just means he's changing into a Lumpy Space guy, on account of my bite. It's just like, um, y'know... werewolf rules? Imitating a werewolf Ar, rawr rawr rawr rawr rawr rawr!"
"Finn says  Oh, no!"
"Jake says  What? You think I'm gonna turn all lumpy like her? Get outta here. Arm suddenly lumps up Wha? Finn, I think I'm freakin' out!"
"Finn says  Calm down, bud! I'll... I'll sock the lumpiness outta ya!"
Teacup falls on the ground and shatters.
"Princess Bubblegum says  Hey, now! Bouncing down Royal intervention! Surely there must be an antidote to the lumps."
"Lumpy Space Princess says  Yeah. There's an antidote, but you have to go all the way to Lumpy Space to get it. And Jake has to use it by sunset."
Princess Bubblegum says  What happens if he doesn't take the antidote by sunset?
"Lumpy Space Princess says  He'll be lumpy, like, forever."
"Finn says  LSP, please! Can you tell us how to reach Lumpy Space?"
"Lumpy Space Princess says  Yeah, I mean, there's a portal nearby. I can show you whenever."
Finn and Jake says  Exiting with Lumpy Space Princess Take us now! Take us now!
Princess Bubblegum says  Intestines grumble I should not have drunk that much tea! Runs off
Lumpy Space Princess says  Don't go telling everyone about this portal or whatever. It's kind of a secret.
Finn and Jake look around.
Finn says  Where is it?
Lumpy Space Princess says  Portal's that Frog and mushroom.
Frog jumps on mushroom with a ribbit.
"Frog says  Password, please."
Lumpy Space Princess says  yells Whatevers2009!!
"Frog says  Good day, Princess. Is your father okay with you entering Lumpy Space with two... puffs out his chest non-Lumpers?"
"Finn says  Whispering to Lumpy Space Princess Just say yes! Yes, yes, yes!"
"Lumpy Space Princess says  Yeah, whatever, fine."
"The frog extends its tongue to the three and sucks them into his mouth, transporting them to Lumpy Space."
Scene changes to Lumpy Space. Finn is thrown toward a lumpy cloud where LSP and Jake are waiting for him.
"Finn says  AAAAH!! Whoa... Lumpy Space. So, where's the antidote?"
"Lumpy Space Princess says  Hold it. First, you should check out my house. It's, like, kind of lame, but way less lame than, like, your house."
"Jake says  Uh, could you skip to the part where you tell us where the antidote is?"
Lumpy Space Princess says  It's up there at Makeout Point.
"Finn says  That's so close! We can run there in no... Camera pans up, revealing that Makeout Point is across an abyss. ...time. Aww, what?!! It's, like, a million-mile fall into space!"
"Lumpy Space Princess says  Yeah. You have to travel by car in my world, or else you'll fall into the Lumpy Abyss."
Lumpy Space King says  Daughter!! Have you brought smooth people into our domain?!
"Lumpy Space Princess says  I had to, Dad... I'm trying to help them, so don't lumping yell at me!"
Lumpy Space Queen says  WHAT DID YOU SAY?! What did you just say?!?
"Lumpy Space Princess says  I SAID, ""LUMP OFF,"" MOM!!! yells gibberish and garbles, ""Oh, my glob"", angrily, then pants heavily"
Finn says  Uh...
Lumpy Space Princess says  To Finn says WHAT?!?!
Finn says  Vroom vroom??
"Lumpy Space Princess says  Oh, yeah. To parents says I need to borrow the car."
"Lumpy Space King says  You have made your mother cry for the last time, daughter! You are hereby banned from using the royal car!! walks inside house and slams the door"
"Lumpy Space Princess says  Shucks! I lumping hate them! I'm really, really sorry, Finn. But I can't help you because my parents are horrible idiots."
Finn says  Don't you know anyone else with a car?
Lumpy Space Princess says  My friend Melissa has a car. But she's dating my ex-boyfriend Brad.
Finn says  frustrated Call her NOW.
Lumpy Space Princess says  Hmm. pulls out cellphone LSP says to her phone says Call BFF 66.
"Elsewhere, Melissa's phone rings."
Melissa says  answering Hello?
"Lumpy Space Princess says  Hey, Melissa. What's up?"
Finn says  What's she saying?
"Lumpy Space Princess says  whispering to Finn I'm asking her, jeez! Melissa, just listen!"
Melissa says  Have you forgotten what day it is?
Lumpy Space Princess says  Melissa. I'm trying to help out some friends.
Melissa says  Tonight is the weekly Promcoming Dance!
"Lumpy Space Princess says  Oh, Glob. I forgot."
Finn says  What'd she say?
"Lumpy Space Princess says  Tonight is the weekly Promcoming Dance! To Melissa, in excitement says It's gonna be so flipping awesome!"
"Finn says  exasperated LSP, we don't have time for this. Ask for the ride, LSP."
"Lumpy Space Princess says  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh—Finn takes the cellphone LSP continues to say oh a couple of times until she realizes her phone is missing Wha?!"
"Finn says  To Melissa, imitating Lumpy Space Princess says Melissa, Lumpy Space Princess tries to retrieve her phone while Finn continues. you should totally drive us to Makeout Point to make out with hot boys!"
"Melissa says  LSP, you're so baaaaad... be there in a sec!"
Finn says  Biyah. hangs up
Lumpy Space Princess says  Hmm. takes phone back
Finn says  Normal voice says Sorry. But Jake's lumpiness is worsening!
"Jake says  Actually, I think I'm beating it back with sheer willpower! Part of his head bulges up. flatly says Oh, my. Forces lump back into body"
"Lumpy Space Princess says  Yeah, whatever. Just don't mess with my phone again."
Melissa arrives on her car.
Melissa says  Hi!
"Melissa drives into Finn, knocking him over."
"Finn says  Ugh... OKAY! Let's go, let's go, let's go!!"
"They ride off, and Melissa's ""SXY-LMP"" liscense plate is revealed. Electronic music plays."
"Jake says  Aw, Finn, this music ducks, right? suddenly in a lumpy accent says Ah. I love this song. We should totally TP Shandala's house! in normal voice says Gracious! That was terrible! Finn, if you can't save me from the lumps... if I do turn... if I become lumpy like them, I want you to—"
"Finn says  while embracing Jake says It's not gonna come to that. But if it does, I'll bury you beneath the nicest, most shadiest tree!"
"Jake says  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm saying that if I go totally lumpy, then I want you to get used to lumpy Jake. What did you think I was sayin'?"
"Finn says  Oh, um... awkwardly Heh heh. angrily towards Melissa says CAN'T THIS CAR GO ANY FASTER?!"
"Melissa says  We're already here! Hi, Finn."
"Lumpy Space Princess says  We've been here for, like, five minutes."
Finn says  Finally! Huh? This doesn't look like Makeout Point.
Melissa says  This is Brad's house. You wanted a ride to Makeout Point? You think I want to make out with you?!
Finn says  Uh...
"Melissa says  blushing Well, maybe I do, but... wait. angrily says I HAVE A BOYFRIEND, FINN!! throws Finn down"
"Finn says  LSP, we gotta hurry! Jake's running out of time!"
"Lumpy Space Princess says  Hey. This is hard for me, too. I mean, I used to eat chili cheese fries with Brad... so there's gonna be a lot of romantic tension on this ride!"
Brad says  Hey.
"Melissa says  Oh, Braaaaad... giggles"
"Brad says  You miss me yet, LSP?"
"Lumpy Space Princess says  sullenly says Scooch over, Finn. I'm gonna sit in the back."
Scene changes to when they arrive at Makeout Point
Lumpy Space Princess says  This is it.
Melissa parks the car.
Finn says  Let's go!
"Lumpy Space Princess says  Wait. Watch yourself, Finn. The guys who use the antidote up here are notorious for being... whispering says smooth posers."
Finn says  What does that mean?
Lumpy Space Princess says  It just means what it means. Hurry. Get the antidote so we can get outta here.
"Finn says  Thanks, LSP."
Lumpy Space Princess says  BUUUUMPS.
Jake says  Um... bumps.
"Finn says  Uh, yeah, bumps."
Jake's skin bulges up more.
"Jake says  Aw, man!"
"They hurry over and come to three Lumpy Space People, Glasses, Monty, and Lenny."
"Finn says  Hey, guys. Lookin' smooth!"
Glasses says  Really? You think we're smooth?
"Finn says  Well, mostly you in the center, but yeah!"
Monty says  Why are you sucking up to us?
Finn says  My best friend needs an antidote for lumpiness.
"Lenny says  Chyah, lumpiness suuucks. Hey, Monty, time's up, sphere-hog! Lenny pushes Monty off an sphere he was sitting on. Monty becomes lumpy. My turn! Lenny sits on the sphere and becomes smooth."
Finn says  So the antidote is in that orb you were sitting on!
"Lenny says  This orb is the antidote, bruh."
Finn says  Can my friend borrow it?
"Lenny says  Yeah, sure, as long as you give it right back. Tosses Finn the sphere and becomes lumpy"
"Finn says  Hammacow. Thanks, fellas."
Lumpy Space Princess enters.
"Lumpy Space Princess says  What's taking so long? Did those smooth-heads give you the orb already, or what?"
Lenny takes the sphere back.
Finn says  Wait!!
Lenny says  Is this another friend of yours?
"Lumpy Space Princess says  What do you care? Just give 'em the antidote already, and stop being such a poser."
"Monty says  Sorry, kid. exiting with Lenny and Glasses says We changed our minds."
Finn says  Why did you have to say all those rude things to them?!
Lumpy Space Princess says  What? I was helping you.
Finn says  sarcastically says Thanks a lot! sincerely says They were right about to hand over the antidote!
Lumpy Space Princess says  bitterly says You're welcome a lot.
Finn says  You insulted them! And they got mad! And now Jake's gonna be lumpy forever! THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT!
"Lumpy Space Princess says  Wow. Now I know how you really feel. I was just trying to help, but whatever. raising her voice says No. No, not whatever! I know I mess things up sometimes, but I'm really trying! And you're supposed to be my friend! tearing up Not like the fake ones I have here! So do what you want! I'm going to Promcoming! Are you coming or not, Lumpy Jake?"
"Jake says  No. Because no matter how messed up and lumpy I get, this guy never turns his back on me! Completely transforms into a Lumpy Space person. Oh, yah. Right behind ya. Just gotta turn my back on this guy. Literally does so then exits"
"Finn says  JAKE! IT'S ALMOST SUNSET!! to himself says Jake... I didn't save him... I... Yells wildly and angrily and then punches the ground repeatedly. I'LL KILL YOU, LUMPY SPAAAAAACE!!"
"Monty says  Jam on, man!"
Finn says  Huh? I thought you guys left!
Monty says  We were drawn back by your plaintive wail. We dig your directionless fury.
"Finn says  Um, thanks."
Monty says  Respect. Here. Tosses Finn the sphere. Take it. Win your girl back!
"Finn says  Yeah, there's no girl. But there is still time to save Jake! Do you guys know where Promcoming is?"
Monty says  Promcoming takes place way down on that land-lump.
Finn says  Awesome. Do any of y'all have wheels?
Monty says  Nah. We were all ditched here just like you.
Finn says  Well... you think I can make it to that land-lump if I jumped off this cliff?
Monty says  You kidding?! A smoothie like you will plummet right into the eternal void!
Finn says  What if I was lumpy? Could I float over?
"Lenny says  No, no! It's too dangerous!"
Glasses says  I'd say there's a 50/50 chance of you making it!
Finn says  That's good enough for me. Now bite me!!
"The three respond in disbelief all at once, then Finn forces them to bite him."
Finn says  turning lumpy exceedingly quickly says Yes! I can feel the multiple bites accelerating the lumpification process! I'm starting to float!
"Lenny says  Don't jump, guy!!"
Finn says  I have to! For my buddy. Jumps. RAAAAAAGH!!!!
Glasses says  Wow. He's insane.
Finn successfully lands through the roof of Promcoming.
"Finn says  Ah, I made it! And there he is!"
Jake says  Yeah! Promcoming! Yeah! Cool!
Finn says  Jake! I'm mostly lumpy now! And I totally think you should sit on this sphere!
Jake says  No!
Finn tries to force him to sit on it to no avail.
Finn says  Sit on it!
Jake says  Slaps sphere down No!!
"Finn says  Please, Jake! You're my best friend! Just sit on the sphere!"
Jake says  Chyah! I remember you! You're just a smoothie wannabe lumpy poser!
Finn says  Sit on it!! Before I turn completely lumpy!!
Jake says  NO!!
"Finn says  Oh, no! I can feel the lumpiness... about to consume me!! Fully transforms into a Lumpy Space person. Oh, yah. Being lumpy's the best."
"Jake says  Hey. Stop talkin' to yourself, dumb guy. Take your ball and get outta here."
Finn says  Fine. I don't want you to have it anyway.
"Jake says  So I can't have it now, eh?"
Finn says  That's right. It's mine.
Jake says  GIMME THAT BALL!!
Finn says  NO! You can't have it!
Jake says  I want it! Give it to me!
"Finn says  You want it that bad? Go get it, then!"
"Jake says  Bumps, bi— Sits on the sphere and turns back to normal. gasps Oh, I'm not lumpy anymore! Oh, no. Finn buddy! You gotta sit on this!"
Finn says  No! You can't make me! Smooth—OOF! Runs into a muscular Lumpy Space person and gets knocked out.
"Jake says  Finn! Hey, Finn! Hey, buddy! Finn"
Finn says  waking up says Huh?
"Jake says  Hey, dude. We made it."
"Finn says  Man... There's something cold under my butt. Noticing sphere says Oh! laughs The antidote! Just in time, too! LSP, I'm sorry I blew up at you before. I didn't mean it. I was just really stressed out."
"Lumpy Space Princess says  You know, it's fine. You and Jake can make it up to me by dancing this last dance with me."
"Finn says  Sounds good to me. Whaddaya say, Jake?"
Jake says  Lumpy voice says That sounds totally lame.
Everyone gasps
"Jake says  Normal voice, laughs I'm just kidding. Let's dance!"
Everyone resumes dancing and the episode ends
"The episode starts with Finn and Jake sledding down hills with an office chair in the Ice Kingdom and laughing. As they go down a hill at high speed they smash of the head of a Snow Golem, who promptly replaces it with a cat's head and meows. As our duo goes up in the air and falls back down, the chair breaks."
"Finn says  Oh, no, our sled's broken! Hey, let's build one out of snow! Starts to gather snow"
Jake grows to giant size
"Finn says  What are you doing, Jake?"
They both laugh
Jake says  Sleds are for suckers. Just ride on my gut.
Finn says  Okay! Jumps onto his gut and they slide down a hill
They slide past Iceclops who reaches for them but falls on his head in the snow
Jake says  Switch!
Jake shrinks down and hops on to Finn's back as he slides down the hills until he begins to freeze
Finn says  Frozen Switch back! Switch back! Jake grows and they switch again as they slide through a horde of penguins
Finn says  Penguins!
"They fall through a tunnel with penguins on Jake's stomach, and they pop out of the end of the tunnel, the penguins fall off and our duo soars through the air"
Finn says  Ha Ha!
Jake says  I'm a flying dog! They fist tap in midair
"Back on the ground, Ice King is shoveling snow into a wheelbarrow when Finn and Jake come crashing down, creating a crater"
Ice King says  What?! Approaches the crater Who dares enter the Ice Kingdom?!
"Finn says  Aww, Ice King's here."
"Ice King says  You know why I'm here? Do you know what ""Ice King"" means?!"
"Jake says  Yeah, I know what ""Ice King"" means says A big nerd!"
Finn says  Oh ho oh! Holy cow!
Ice King says  It means I'm King of Ice! This is my domain! And you are violating Ice World law--trespassing!
"Jake says  Come on, brother! We're just trying to beat the heat."
"Finn says  Yeah! There's a big sleeping lava man in our front yard, and he is SOOOOOOOOOOOO hot!"
Jake says  Mmm-hmm!
"Finn says  Wait, wait, no, I take it back. I mean, not like ""sexy"" hot."
"Jake says  No, no, you do mean ""sexy"" hot."
"Finn says  No, I mean--"
Ice King says  Annoyed I don't care! This is my kingdom. You guys can't just scoot about on my land willy-nilly. I've got rules here.
Finn and Jake are building a small snowman
Finn says  Sighs Why don't you just try being cool.
"Ice King says  Flips out What?! I am the king! I am the king of c-cool c-co ca... That's it! Rise, monsters of snow, and go beat up Finn and Jake! Uses magic to bring out snow monsters"
Jake says  Uh oh.
Finn says  Laughs
Finn and Jake fight the snow monsters and win
"Ice King says  Angry Ooh, you guys are gonna get it."
"Finn says  Heh heh, yeah."
"Jake says  Yeah, right, sure."
"Ice King freezes them where they stand, Ice King is later seen pushing them up a hill to his castle in his wheelbarrow"
"Ice King says  Groans I need a magic back. Cracks his back and pulls out a plastic sandwich bag Trail mix. Begins to pick around in it Ick...ooh, yogurt chip. Eats yogurt chip and puts the bag away Tuck, tuck. Begins to push the wheelbarrow again Aww man."
"In the Ice King's castle Ice King comes into a room with a jail cell in a room where Lumpy Space Princess, Hot Dog Princess, Emerald Princess, Ghost Princess, Slime Princess, Raggedy Princess, and Wildberry Princess held captive"
"Ice King says  I'm back home! Hello, ladies!"
The princesses begin to mutter in panic
"Ice King says  Now, now. I've brought you a baby and a puppy. Tosses Finn and Jake into the room, where they smash against the wall and are freed from the ice"
Wildberry Princess says  Finn! Are you okay?
"Finn says  Huh, Wildberry Princess? Hot Dog Princess? W-what's goin' on?"
"Slime Princess says  We're all prisoners, Finn."
Finn says  Ice King!
Ice King says  What?
"Finn says  Why are you keeping these girls prisoners, jerk?"
Ice King says  You don't understand! I collect princesses because I want to marry one.
"Jake says  Well, why'd you capture six of them if you just want to marry one?"
"Ice King says  I'm collecting them all first to be sure I make the right choice. You're both too young to understand, but marriage is a serious thing and lasts forever. You can't just rush into it, you know?"
"Finn says  Ice King, don't do this. Just let the girls go. They don't want to be here."
Ice King says  Of course they do! I would have killed them already if they didn't want to be here. Right ladies? Shoots ice lighting from his fingers Zzhp Zzhp.
Princesses says  Mm-hm.
"Finn says  Sighs Don't worry, princesses. I pledge that Jake and I will protect each and everyone of you and furthermore I see all of you happily married to whatever sweet thing y'all want to be married to!"
Slime Princess says  Yay!
Ice King says  Grumbles
"Finn says Rad! All I need is something to spear the Ice King with. Begins to search through his backpack Binoculars... toothbrush...water bottle...rope... Worried tone sweater... trail mix... my flute! Pulls out a broken, bandaged flute and plays it"
"Finn throws the flute at Ice King, and it falls apart before it gets out of the cell"
Finn says  My flute!
"Jake says  Aw, nuts, dude! You broke it when we tried picking the lock to that sad ogre's heart!"
Finn says  Darn it!
Ice King laughs and does a little dance
"Ice King says Nice try, boy! Princesses, did you see? Did you see Finn fail?"
"Jake says  Don't worry, Finn. I'll get us out of here with Key Hand! Hah-hah! Uses Key Hand"
"Ice King says  Oh, no you won't! Freezes Jake from the neck down"
Finn says  Jake!
Ice King says  Eat it.
Jake says  Frozen I... I'm okay.
Finn says  Ice King! You better either set us free or come in here and fight me 'cause otherwise I'm gonna flip out!!!
Finn flails his arms and legs at the Ice King through the bars but he doesn't even touch him
"Ice King says  Oh, are you trying to hit me? Well, excuse me because I have to go potty in the bathroom. Goes to the bathroom"
Finn says  ICE KING!!!...
Jake says  Finn!
"Finn says  Huh? Jake, you alright?"
"Jake says  I'm fine, buddy. Calm down and tend to the princesses."
"Finn says  Oh my gosh. I'm sorry, princesses. Slime Princess, are you alright?"
"Slime Princess says  He's held us here for weeks, questioning us about our favorite sports and quirky behavior. I've tried to tell him as little as possible."
"Finn says  I understand. And, Lumpy Space Princess, how do you fair?"
"Lumpy Space Princess says  I'm bored, and I'm not having any fun."
"Ice King says  Returning What? Not having any fun? But last night I read you the story of ""Baby Whatsit and the Bottle Prince."""
Lumpy Space Princess says  That wasn't fun. That was lame.
"Ice King says  Other princesses, do you feel the same way?"
The princesses mumble
"Ice King says  Well, here, watch. I'll show you. We'll have some fun. Fun's my middle name."
He goes to his electric piano and play a tune and hums along with it
"Ice King says  Here, now, Wildberry Princess. I need you to play this. Puts the piano by the cell"
Wildberry Princess says  I don't know how.
"Ice King says  Well, come here, I'll teach you. Put your hand through the bars, atta princess, and uh... Guides Wildberry Princess' hand to play the tune"
Wildberry Princess says  I don't think I can.
Ice King says  Just play it like I showed you.
"Finn says  Leave her alone, Ice King!"
Ice King says  PLAY IT OR I'LL SQUISH YOU INTO JUICE!!!
Wildberry Princess says  Oh dear! Plays the tune
"Ice King says  Yeah, keep playing it. Now everyone pick up an instrument and play it. Oh, this is going to be so much fun!"
"Finn growls and Ice King goes to his drums and begins going into an drum solo out of key with the music the princesses are playing, Finn looks around"
"Jake says  What are you thinking, Finn?"
Finn says  I've almost devised a plan. I'm gonna let him drum till' I've finalized the details in my mind.
Jake says Sweet
Ice King continues to drum until he pushes the drums apart and laughs
"Ice King says  Oh, that was fun!"
"Finn says  Ah! It was fun! Hey, you should get some more fun stuff."
"Ice King says  You're right! Good idea, Finn."
"Finn says  ""Good idea,"" indeed."
Ice King says  I hope they think I'm fun. He leaves
"Finn says  Alright. I've got a plan on how to get out of here. First everyone needs to be dancing and laughing and saying fun stuff like ""Whoopee""! Okay, when the Ice King comes back, everyone play it up, like we want him to come inside the jail and party with us and when he steps inside, I'm gonna beat the tar out of him with these... Shows his fists ...while you all take care of Jake. Everyone on board with this?"
The princesses mumble in agreement
"Jake says  Sweet plan, dude!"
"Lumpy Space Princess says  I think by everyone saying ""whoopee"" the plan won't work cause he'll know we're faking it."
"Finn says  Good point, Lumpy Space Princess."
"Lumpy Space Princess says  I'm gonna say something fun like ""Oh yeah, I'm having a fun time! Oh my gosh, havin' the best time I've ever had in my entire life!"""
Ice King reenters the room with a board game
"Ice King says  Make way for the fun tray! Whoa, what's happening?"
Everyone in the jail cell is partying
Ice King says  What is this?
Finn says  We're having fun! Whoopee!
Ice King says  Because I left the room?
Jake says  Because they like it here. Because they like you. Because you're a really fun guy!
Ice King says  I don't get this.
Finn says  whispering He's not buying it. Dance harder.
They dance faster
Lumpy Space Princess says  Come on in here and party.
"Finn says  Wanna dance with us, Ice King? Come on!"
Ice King says  Me? You want to dance with me?
Lumpy Space Princess says  Oh yeah! Whoo! Woohoo!
Ice King says  Drops the board game Wow! Opens cell door and walks in Yes! Yes! Whoopee!
Finn jump kicks him and the princesses run out of the room carrying Jake
"Ice King says  Wait, no! Shoots ice lighting at Emerald Princess, but she avoids it Don't leave! I'll kill you all! Finn punches him and Ice King tries to push him away Why are you doing this? Everyone was finally warming up to me."
"Finn says  No! That is not the case! You're nuts, man! And I don't know how to help you! Probably because I'm just a simple dude. So maybe you should talk to someone with more life experience, like Jake!"
Jake is being ice picked free by Hot Dog Princess and Wildberry Princess
"Jake says  Whoa, whoa, whoa, Finn, what are you doing? Don't dump the Ice King on me!"
"Finn says  But you gotta get it in you're head, man! Putting princesses in jail is wrong!"
Ice King jumps up
"Ice King says  Bah! Finn, you just ruined my chances with 5 or 6 potential wives! For that you will... Finn punches him in the beard Ohh! Oh, my beard. Finn roundhouse kicks him into a wall where his crown falls off and he loses consciousness"
"In a dream Ice King is having, he is flying through space, naked and covered by his beard"
Ice King says  Why do people not like me? Is it because I'm a magic user or is my beard too shaggy? Sighs I try so hard to be a good husband for girls. What's wrong with me?
The Cosmic Owl appears
Cosmic Owl says  Hoo. You're a sociopath.
Ice King says  Who are you? Laughs I know. You're probably a--a big nerd! Why don't you try being cool like me? Flies away laughing when he regains consciousness and is being tickled by penguins Star dust is so ticklish! Laughs until he opens his eyes What happened? Princesses? Ohhh...
"Outside in the Ice Kingdom, Jake is carrying Finn and the princesses on his back, everyone is cheering happily"
"Slime Princess says  Thank you, Finn."
"Finn says  Picks her up You're welcome, Slime Princess!"
Slime Princess says  And remember when you vowed to marry us to the thing of our choosing?
Finn says  Yeah...
"Slime Princess says  Well, I'd like to marry you."
Everyone else says  Ooooh!
"Finn says  Awkwardly Oh, heh heh, well how 'bout that...whispers Jake, help me!"
"Jake says  Oh, eh... Slime Princess, you shouldn't marry Finn. He pees his pants constantly. All the time."
Princesses says  Ewww!
"Slime Princess says  Oh, gross! Put me down! Put me down!!!"
"Finn says  Heh heh, I'm sorry. Jake! Angrily grunts"
Jake laughs as the Adventure Time logo appears and the episode ends
"The episode starts with Finn and Jake walking away from an unknown, burning city"
Finn says  Singing Baby!
Jake says  Ooo!
Finn says  Singing I know what you need.
Jake says  What's that?
"Finn says  Singing You want your little baby socks, for your little baby feet."
Jake says  Woo!
Finn says  Singing Baby!
Jake says  Yeah?
Finn says  Singing I know what you crave.
"Jake says  Oh, yeah? What's that?"
"Finn says  Singing You want to poop your pants all day long. Well, baby behave!"
"Jake says  Hey, how can you sing like that, dude?"
Finn says  Remember when I swallowed that little computer?
"Jake says  Oh, yeah."
Finn and Jake arrive at a small house and drop off fruits and a string of sausages at the doorstep
"Finn says  Alright, Stanley. You and your family are safe... Again..."
"Jake says  Seriously, Stanley. For a watermelon you get into trouble way more often than you should."
Finn and Jake are walking across the Grass Lands and Jake is whistling
"A creature rolls up behind them, whistling and knocks Jake off his feet"
Jake says  W-whoa!
Finn says  What the... Shmow-zow! Look at that!
"Jake says  That... is the most adorable thing I have ever seen. And he loves your baby song. Sing some more of it, dude."
Finn says  Alright. Singing Baby! You lookin' so good. You lookin' like you might... want some baby food.
The creature is dancing along to the song
"Jake says  Keep it going, man! Laughs"
Finn says  Singing Baby! You lookin' so fine. You lookin' like you might... just start cryin'.
Jake says  Laughs Yeah!
Finn says  Dude! This guy... is a pal for life! It looks like he's got two jiggly bellies stuck together.
Jake says  I've got that on my back. I call it my butt.
The creature jiggles Jake's butt
Jake says  Whoa!
Finn says  Laughs He's the Jiggler.
Finn says  Laughs You are the best thing ever. Let's take the Jiggler back to the house and just stick him by our bed so we can wake up...
Finn &amp; Jake says  Next to a little dancing guy every morning!
"Finn, Jake and the Jiggler walk towards the Tree Fort"
"Finn says  Singing I gotta tuck you in, girl. I gotta sing you sweet melodies about babies. Yeah!"
Jake says  Little baby feet!
The scene changes to inside the Tree Fort
Finn says  Carrying the Jiggler on his back Welcome to your new home. Feast your eyes on... everything!
Jiggler says  Whistles
"Finn grunts and tears a toothbrush in half, vertically"
Jake says  What are you doing?
"Finn says  Splitting my toothbrush in half, so he can use half."
Finn says  Handing half to the Jiggler Here you go. It's for your teeth.
Finn says  Mimes brushing his teeth Like this.
The Jiggler swishes the toothbrush around the inside of its mouth
Finn says  Yeah! You got it.
Jake says  Enough hygiene. Putting a record into a phonograph Let's get to it!
Music plays and the Jiggler begins to dance while holding its toothbrush
Finn says  Yeah! Toothbrush dance. Laughs This is cool!
"They all start dancing together, Finn and Jake copying the Jiggler's moves"
Jake breaks a table in half while dancing
Finn says  Flipping the freezer over Yeah!
Finn and Jake break more objects while dancing and laughing
The scene cuts to night-time
"Finn says  Nodding his head Dance... dance... Yawn dance... Snapping upright I'm not tired! How about you, Jake?"
Jake is sleeping on the floor
Finn says  Grabbing the Jiggler and climbing the ladder Maybe we should go upstairs.
Finn says  Placing the Jiggler in his bed You can have the comfiest spot on the bed. Goodnight. Whistles
Jiggler says  Whistles
Finn blows out the candle and curls up on the end of his bed
"The scene changes to morning, where Jake is making tea"
"Finn says  Mornin', Jake!"
Jake says  Yawns Mornin'.
Finn says  Are you ready to get down? Synthesizer voice Let's get this party started!
"Jake says  Laughs Yeah, ok."
Finn says  Where's the little guy?
Jake says  Pointing with his cup Over there.
The Jiggler is face-down on the back of a bench
"Finn says  Hey, pal. You ready to cut loose? Wake and shake, buddy. Let's do this thing! Whistles"
Jiggler says  Whistles pathetically
Jake says  Slam-a-cow! That fool looks rumped.
Finn says  What do you mean?
"Jake says  Well, look at him. He's all limp... and weird."
Finn says  Aww... I bet he just needs some breakfast after a night of extraordinary jiggling. Hey! Let's combine everything we can find in the kitchen... and have the Jiggler drink it! That'll wake him up! And then we can... Get Synthesizer voice doooowwwn!
Jiggler says  Whistles pathetically
"Jake says  He doesn't want to drink that goop, man."
"Finn says  Then let's just give him some, uh... purple whatevers."
Jake says  You mean the grapes?
Finn says  Yeah. Whatever.
Finn feeds the Jiggler a grape and the Jiggler swallows it
Finn says  Hey! I think he's diggin' it!
The Jiggler's body contorts and it makes a strange humming noise
Jake says  That doesn't sound good.
The Jiggler's body violently changes color and shape
Finn &amp; Jake says  Screaming
The Jiggler stops contorting and changing color
Finn says  Uhh...
"Jake says  Looking at one of the Jiggler's holes as it leaks a pink juice Uh, you think we... think we fed the wrong hole?"
Jake flips the Jiggler upside-down
Finn says  Nah. He just doesn't like purple whatevers. What we need to do is figure out what he likes to eat.
"Finn says  Drawing pictures Here, Jiggler. What kind of food do you like? Meat? Some banana? This looks like corn... I think. Uh... hot dog. Stanley the watermelon."
Finn says  Showing the drawings to the Jiggler Look! Jake! He likes it!
The Jiggler reaches up and pulls the drawings off of the paper
Finn says  Gasp Wow!
Jake says  No way!
The Jiggler slurps the drawings into its mouth and eats them
Finn says  His favorite food... is drawings! Awesome!
"Jake says  Holy fig, that's awesome! What food are you drawing now?"
Finn says  I'm drawing a picture of you.
"Jake says  Distressed Well, don't feed it me!"
"Finn says  Laughs and offers the drawing to the Jiggler Come on. Eat him up, Jiggler!"
"The Jiggler slurps the drawing off of the paper, but Jake pulls him away before he can eat it"
Jake says  No!
The drawing of Jake floats towards them
Jake says  Running away with the Jiggler Ahhh! Keep it away! Shoo! Shoo! Screaming
Finn says  Grabs the drawing Alright. Alright. I got it. Calm down... I'll eat it. Opening his mouth Ahhhhh.
Jake says  Snatches the drawing away from Finn Dude! You eating me is just as bad as the Jiggler eating me.
"Finn says  Well... You gonna eat yourself, tough guy?"
Jake says  Yes. If that is what must be done.
Jake chews the drawing of himself and swallows
Jake says  I taste awesome.
Finn &amp; Jake says  Laughing
"Finn says  Ok. Alright. Now, let's get back to some jiggling!"
Jake says  I'll get the tunes!
The Jiggler is shaking and whimpering
Finn and Jake are dancing
Finn says  Like this. Yeah! Woo! Come on Jiggler! wiggle and whistle!
"Jake says  Yeah, Jiggler. Go nuts! Go nuts like there's bugs on your butts!"
"The Jiggler, looking sick, shakes its head and then pink juice spurts out of the hole on the top of its head and it collapses"
Jake says  Whoa!
Finn says  Gasps Jiggler?
Jake says  What the heck? What's wrong with him?
Finn says  Uh... There's nothing wrong with him. We just gotta plug up his holes.
Finn sticks his finger into the hole that is gushing juice
"Finn says  See? That worked. Ready to jiggle again, little guy?"
Juice gushes from a different hole
Finn says  Whoa!
"Jake says  Oh, man..."
"Jake plugs up the hole that is leaking, but another hole starts to leak"
Finn says  Plugging the new hole with his finger Quick! We gotta plug those holes!
Jake walks away and juice gushes all over Finn
"Finn says  Jake, hurry!"
Jake says  All I could find was your glass eye collection!
Finn says  What about your eyepatch collection?
"Jake says  Aw, man. They're in mint condition."
Finn says  Jake!
Jake says  Running over with glass eyes and eyepatches Alright! Coming!
Finn and Jake start plugging up the Jiggler's holes with glass eyes and eyepatches
"Jake says  One... more... patch! Sigh Finished. Ugh. He looks terrible. Finn, I know you don't want to hear this, but I think we should cut our losses and bring this fella back to where we found him."
"Finn says  We can't just abandon him. Look at him, Jake. He needs us now more than ever. To Jiggler Just need to take better care of you from now on, right little guy?"
"The Jiggler swells and then explodes, spraying pink juice everywhere"
Finn says  Jiggler!
The Jiggler's body stretches in every direction and drapes the inside of the Tree Fort like taffy
Jake says  Oh... Finn. Ok... Our pet exploded.
Finn says  Distressed screaming
Jake says  Maybe we can... scrape him up! And... eyuhh...
"Finn says  Gasp Oh, holy moly! Don't worry, Jiggler. We'll fix you. Whistles"
"The Jiggler tries to whistle, but only makes raspberry noises"
"Finn says  Let's gather him up, Jake. He's all over the place... even between the floorboards!"
Jake says  And the cupboards!
Finn says  And the galoshes!
Jake says  I wonder... Where's his heinie?
Jake looks over and sees the Jiggler's heinie on their phonograph
"Jake says  Found it! Come here, you!"
The Jiggler's heinie jumps away and runs around
Jake says  Hey!
Finn and Jake gather all of the Jiggler and bring him together
Finn says  Come on. Let's put him back together.
Jake says  Ok.
Finn says  Squeeze real hard. He's slipping!
Finn and Jake hug with the Jiggler in between them
Jake says  Got him!
The Jiggler gets pressed back into a globular mass
"Jake says  Well, at least he's all in one piece."
The Jiggler collapses
Jake says  Sheesh. You think he's dead?
"Finn says  No way! I won't let you die, guy! Not this time."
Finn blows into various holes on the Jiggler's head and then kisses it
"Jake says  Finn. Stop it, man. What are you doing?"
Finn says  I'm kissing him! What do you think? It's all I could think to do.
Jake says  Just put him down.
Finn lays him down and the Jiggler makes kissing motions with its lips
The Jiggler begins leaving many different colored kiss-marks on the floor
Finn says  He's kissing colors with his dying breath.
The Jiggler has painted a picture with his colored kiss-marks
"Jake says  I think he's trying to tell us something. Finn, this looks like it could be his Mama Jiggler"
"The Jiggler crawls up to the image of its mother and hugs it, whistling"
"Finn says  We took this child away from its mama, Jake. We're kidnappers and murderers! I just wanted to have fun and jiggle!"
"Jake says  Look... Chill out, ok? We can fix this. Check it out. Pointing to a house in the background of the image His mom looks like she's out by Stanley's house... where we found the Jiggler. If we get him back to her, she'll be able to fix him up!"
Finn says  Picking up the Jiggler Then there's no time to spare.
"The scene changes to the Grass Lands, near where they found the Jiggler"
"Finn says  Holding the Jiggler Shhh. Just hold on a little longer, buddy."
There is a whistling sound in the distance
Jake says  Did you hear that? Whistling!
Finn and Jake enter a cave
Finn says  Perpendicular! It's the mama!
"Mama Jiggler and several babies are sitting and splashing in a pool of pink juice, which is pouring out of Mama Jiggler's holes"
The Jiggler stretches towards them and whistles pathetically
Jake says  Look! The little guy wants to go home!
"Finn says  Setting the Jiggler down Well. This is it, buddy."
Jake says  Waving Be well.
"The Jiggler walks up to Mama Jiggler and she sniffs it; She goes into a rage, screeching and changing colors"
Finn says  Running to the Jiggler Hey! Stop that!
Finn fends off Mama Jiggler and carries the Jiggler to safety
Finn says  I don't understand. That crazy mama almost killed him.
Jake says  He feels cold.
"Finn says  What are we supposed to do now, man? We can't bring him home, or he'll... or he'll..."
Finn tears up and the Jiggler deflates a little
Finn says  Dang it! Why doesn't she love him? I love him! To Jake You love him! It's not fair! Running Ahhhh!
"Jake says  Finn, wait!"
"Finn runs at Mama Jiggler with the Jiggler in his arms, but she goes into a rage again and attacks him"
Finn says  Mama's supposed to love baby! She's supposed to love baby!
Jake says  Huh?
Jake notices the other babies floating in the pool of pink juice
"Jake says  Sniffs the air and then himself Oh, man!"
"Finn says  It's yours, idiot!"
Finn jumps up on top of Mama Jiggler's head and holds the Jiggler up close to her face
Finn says  Don't you recognize your own baby?
"Jake says  Stretches his arms, grabbing Finn and pulling him back Finn! I figured it out, dude. It's the juice. The Jiggler needs to smell like its mama's juice. That's how wild animals know what’s going on... and this guy right here is all drained out. We gotta toss it in the soup, brother."
"Finn says  Alright. Ok. To the Jiggler I loved you, baby. I hope you know that."
Finn says  Tossing the Jiggler at Mama Jiggler Word to your motheeeerrrrr!
The Jiggler flies through the air and lands in the pool of juice; It now looks normal and begins to whistle
"Mama Jiggler picks it up and sniffs it, then holds it against her cheek and they both whistle"
Finn &amp; Jake says  Awww...
Finn says  I'll never kidnap again.
Jake says  You said it! That was a nightmare.
The episode ends
"The episode begins with Ice King flying with Princess Bubblegum, cackling deviously."
"Finn says  Hey, fart-face!!"
Ice King says  Huh?
Finn says  Unhand Princess Bubblegum!!
Ice King says  Foolish interlopers! Zah! Fires ice magic at Finn
Finn says  Evading it Whoa! Throws a snowball at him Ah!
Ice King says  Ee hee hee hee—OOH! Gets hit by snowball MY EYESIGHT!
"Jake forms his posterior into Princess Bubblegum's shape while Finn puts two rocks on it, representing her eyes. He replaces Princess Bubblegum with his posterior without Ice King noticing."
Princess Bubblegum says  Huh? Hee hee hee!
"Finn says  Hey, Ice King! I bet you'll never kiss the princess!"
"Ice King says  I will kiss her! I will! To ""princess"" Hold still. Kisses Jake's posterior Mwah!"
Finn says  Laughs You just kissed Jake's butt!
"Ice King says  What?! Jake reforms his posterior. EEEEGH!! The other three laugh. Flying away The hour is yours, but the day shall be mine! Just like you, Princess—MINE!"
"Princess Bubblegum says  What a patoot. Thanks for saving the day yet again, boys."
"Finn says  You're welcome, Princess. She hugs him. Uh... He blushes, and Jake raises his eyebrow, amused."
Princess Bubblegum says  I'm gonna throw you two a party. Meet at the Candy Kingdom—TONIGHT!
"The three cheer. ""PARTY TIME"" logo pops up and balloons fill up the screen to shift to the next scene. Finn and Jake are walking to the Candy Castle through the Cotton Candy Forest."
Jake says  That paper crane for Princess Bubblegum?
Finn says  I just thought I'd bring 'er a gift... in return for throwing us this party.
Jake says  Heh. I bet you wish you were my butt.
Finn says  What?
"Jake says  I bet you wish you were my butt, because then the princess would... No, wait... I bet you wish you were the Ice King and the princess was my butt!"
Finn says  What?!
"Jake says  Hmm... Snapping OH! I bet you wish Bubblegum would kiss you, too! Like the Ice King and my butt! Hahahaha!"
"Finn says  That's ridiculous! Finn imagines Princess Bubblegum kissing him, and he sighs contentedly. Huh? Uggghhh!! Jake runs ahead laughing. What's so funny?"
Hard cut to the Candy Castle
"Peppermint Butler says  Hey, everybody. Finn and Jake are here."
Jake says  Who's ready to party?!
The crowd seems focused on and gathered around something else. Finn and Jake confusedly look at each other.
Finn says  What's everyone laughing at?
Wildberry Princess says  Shh!
"Ricardio says  Stand back, everyone. This style of massage is called, ""Best Friend Massage."""
"Lumpy Space Princess says  Oh, my gosh..."
Ricardio says  Because it can only be done for friends. It is completely consensual.
"Lumpy Space Princess says  Oh, holy cow..."
"Ricardio says  Relax yourself now, Lumpy Space Princess... YAH! Backflips and pounds her"
Lumpy Space Princess says  Oh! I feel so great!
Finn says  Who is that guy?
Ricardio says  Hahaaa!
Jake shrugs. A fanfare is heard and Princess Bubblegum enters.
"Princess Bubblegum says  Greetings, party-goers! Glad you could all make it!"
"Finn says  Princess Bubblegum! Ricardio stares at her and he himself starts ""beating"" hard. Princess. I just wanted to thank you for—"
"Lumpy Space Princess says  Cutting in Oh, my gosh! PB, ya gotta check out this super cute guy. You're gonna love 'im. They leave Finn and Jake."
Finn says  Uhhh...
"Lumpy Space Princess says  This is... Oh. Oh, my gosh. I don't even know your name."
"Ricardio says  Ricardio. Ricardio at your service. I've been waiting all evening to meet you, Princess. Kissing her hand Mwah! Finn pockets his gift, irritated. I've heard you appreciate ancient technology. Have you ever used the balbaflonic laser to align the hybernotalist rift in the bubaflon plasmodial formation?"
"Princess Bubblegum says  Whoa! No, I haven't! Music starts up; crowd moves to the dance floor. Wanna continue this conversation on the dance floor?"
"Ricardio says  Exiting with her It would be my pleasure, Princess."
Finn says  Why didn't the princess invite me to dance?
"Jake says  If you wanna dance, just go dance!"
Finn says  But now she's dancing with him! Ah... I feel... weird!
"Jake says  Huh, it sounds like you're dealing with some new emotions you don't understand... like jealousy."
Finn says  BLAAAARGH!!
"Jake says  Look, man, just go out there and get down! Pushes him onto the dance floor"
Ricardio says  To Princess Bubblegum —transmordial layers completely independent of the babylons. Eh?
Princess Bubblegum says  Wow! That would mean that the babylons would fluctuate with the piranha-nanosphere!
Ricardio says  Correct!
"Finn says  Agh! Goes back to Jake They're talkin' about science, man! I can't compete with that!"
Jake says  Do the Science Dance! Remember it? It was sorta like this. Does it Wah unh we ah eeh...
Finn says  You think that'll work?
"Jake says  Yeah! Probably. Pushes him back onto the dance floor Do it, man! You're a pro!"
Finn says  Dancing Science Dance! Science Dance!
Ricardio says  Still talking with Bubblegum —lower proximities to—
"Finn says  Science Dance! Hey, eh, Princess! You wanna spend some time with me?"
"Ricardio says  Excuse me, Princess. You must excuse me. Exits"
"Princess Bubblegum says  Oh, uh... Alright! To Finn Finn, what the cabbage? I was learning about Zanoits!"
Finn says  Prevaricating Oh... I'm... into Zanoits! Th-They're the best!
Princess Bubblegum says  Zanoits kill hundreds of thousands of Plantoids a year.
"Finn says  Oh, no, not the Plantoids!"
Princess Bubblegum says  Plantoids produce mellotoxin! Finn stares. Mellotoxin kills Zanoits!!
Finn says  ...So are Zanoits... good things?
Princess Bubblegum says  Changing the subject You're totally jealous of Ricardio.
"Finn says  No, I'm not. I just don't like the way he talks to you. It makes me feel weird."
"Princess Bubblegum says  That's jealousy, hun."
Finn says  I'm not jealous! I'M WEIRD!!!
The party notices Finn's scene.
"Jake says  To himself Woof! Man... This is goin' bad. Hey, Finn. You gotta come help me slay these peanut monsters at the bar. It can't wait. He and Finn are alone. Wow, man, what happened out there?"
"Finn says  Agh... I don't know! I was tryin' to warn 'er, but she twisted my words around and—"
"Jake says  Yeah. Ladies are twisty, man. Bubblegum's super smart, too."
Finn says  I know! And I can't shake this weird feeling about Ricardio. I think he's... a villain.
Jake says  Why? Is it because his face is so foldy and dramatic?
Finn says  No! I can just feel it in my gut! He's up to something sinister!
Jake says  Maybe what you feel is romantic rivalry.
Finn says  I'll prove he's a villain!
Jake says  How?
Finn says  Stakeout.
"Scene shifts to outside in the Candy Kingdom. Finn and Jake are on a roof, and Finn is looking through binoculars."
Finn says  Here he comes! Viewing Ricardio and Princess Bubblegum They're talking!
"Jake says  Lemme see. Gets binoculars I can read their lips. Mimicking Princess Bubblegum ""Hey, shorty, you should pick your boogers and then fart!"" Mimicking Ricardio ""You look kind of like a big pink baguette!"""
"Finn says  Taking back binoculars Get serious, Jake!! This is life and death!"
"Jake says  Is it? Don't get me wrong. I'm all about stakeouts and spying on this guy, but what if he's not a villain? What if he just looks wicked? Some people look wicked but are super nice."
Finn says  I gotta trust my gut!
Jake says  Grabbing gut Hmm.
Finn says  He's on the move! Let's roll! The two swing onto a Guardian of the Royal Promise. I see 'im. He's holding rope and going into the trash. He's smashing bottles—and pretending to stab someone!
Jake says  So... he's recycling... or what?
"Finn says  Takes off binoculars I think your gut's a little naive, Jake. Puts on binoculars Holy moly! He's... he's with the Ice King! They're shouting something! Ice King and Ricardio quarrel. Ricardio is tossing him in the dumpster and running away!"
"Jake says  So I was right! He is a good guy who's just cursed to look suspicious! To gut You and me, gut! Together forever! Solvin' crimes and makin' up rhymes!"
Finn says  No way. This proves he's a super-villain! More powerful than lesser villains like the Ice King!
Jake sings the Gut Song.
Finn says  Then it's settled! We're gonna confront Ricardio face-to-face and prove he's evil!
Jake says  Or good!
Scene cuts to downtown in the Candy Kingdom. Ricardio walks deviously and accidentally runs into Finn.
Ricardio says  Oof!
"Finn says  So what're you doin', Ricardio? Are you evil?"
Jake says  Or nice with an evil face?
Ricardio says  That's none of your business.
Finn says  The safety of Princess Bubblegum is my business!
"Jake says  Yeah, we just wanna know if you're evil or not."
"Ricardio says  Oh, yeah?"
Finn &amp; Jake In unison says  Yeah.
"Ricardio says  Oh, yeah?"
Jake says  Yeah. Slightly annoyed Yes!
Finn says  You stay away from Princess Bubblegum with all that stuff!
"Ricardio says  Now that my plan is nearly complete, there is no way you could stop me."
Finn says  I could stop you if I wanted!
"Ricardio says  Oh, yeah?"
Finn says  Yeah!
"Ricardio says  Oh, yeah??"
Finn says  YEEEAAAH!!!
"Finn punches Ricardio, knocking him down. Princess Bubblegum enters."
Princess Bubblegum says  Gasps What's going on here?
Finn says  Princess?!
Princess Bubblegum says  Ricardio?!
"Ricardio says  Weakly Yes... I'm alright, Princess."
Princess Bubblegum says  Finn... why'd you do it?
Finn says  He was gonna hurt you with those ropes and bottles!
Princess Bubblegum says  These were for our balbaflonic laser.
"Ricardio says  It's not all his fault, Princess. I might've looked a little threatening."
Princess Bubblegum says  Finn... you shouldn't punch brainiacs. You know how fragile they are! You gotta stop this jealous business.
Finn says  But...
"Princess Bubblegum says  C'mon, Ricardio. I'll patch you up and give you candy. They exit."
Finn says  Sigh She hates me now. I was totally wrong about Ricardio.
"Ice King says  No, Finn! Emerges from dark alleyway You were not wrong. He is evil! Collapses"
Finn says  Ice King! What do you know about this? Tell me or I'll do something!
"Jake says  Hold up, Finn! The Ice King looks sorta damaged!"
Finn says  I don't care! I only care about Ricardio!
"Ice King says  But my enervated condition has everything to do with him. Flashback begins; Ice King does voice-over I was trying to cast a spell that would give me total control of Princess Bubblegum's heart! ...But I messed it all up... and lost control of mine. Ricardio come's out of Ice King's chest in flashback. He runs towards the window laughing. He planned to rip out Princess Bubblegum's heart... to make it his bride. Ricardio sticks his tongue out and exits laughing. Without my heart, I grew weak. Ice King groans in flashback. But I made my way to the Candy Kingdom to look for him. In an alleyway, I begged him to In flashback, Ice King mouths these words as current Ice King says them return to me and leave the princess alone. Flashback ends. But he threw me in the dumpster and left me for dead. Reaching his hand out at Finn Stop Ricardio!"
"Finn says  Slapping hand away Agh! Come on, Jake! They run to the Candy Castle. Gotta save the princess!"
They enter.
Jake says  Princess Bubblegum!!
Finn says  Princess!! Gasps
Princess Bubblegum says  Finn!! Jake!!
She is tied up in the rope from earlier and Ricardio is next to her with the broken bottle in his hand.
"Ricardio says  You were right all along, Finn! Now I'm going to cut out Princess Bubblegum's heart and make out with it!"
Finn says  Not if I can help it!
"They chase Ricardio, and Ricardio ends up next to Bubblegum again."
Ricardio says  One step closer and I'll remove her heart!!
Princess Bubblegum says  Finn! I feel like a big idiot for doubting you! He was just so engaging! ...But his knowledge on plantoids is actually pretty weak.
"Ricardio says  Shut your mouth up, Princess! Jake knocks Ricardio down by stretching his jowl at him. I'm gonna smooch that heart!! It will be my bride!!"
Finn says  Why don't you marry someone your own size?! Like my foot?!
Ricardio says  Huh?!
Finn kicks him.
Finn says  And my fist?!
Finn punches him twice.
"Ice King says  Crawling in Stop! Stop it! That's my heart, you piece of—"
Finn says  Ice King. Ice King crawls towards Ricardio. Should we... let 'im take his heart back? He is... villainous...
"Jake says  I don't wanna watch an old man die on Princess Bubblegum's carpet, man."
"Ice King says  Oh, yeah..."
Ricardio says  Wait! Wait! No!
Ice King says  Come to daddy...
Ricardio says  Noooooooooo!
"Ice King says  Yeah, there you go... Puts him in his chest Like that? Huh?"
Ricardio says  Sinking into chest Seeee you guys laterrrr...
"Ice King says  Reinvigorated I feel wonderful! Hahaha! And now that I've saved the Princess, she'll marry me and live in my dungeon every day!"
"Finn says  No, she won't!"
"Princess Bubblegum says  Yeah, no, I won't!"
"Ice King says  Yes you WILL! He charges up his ice magic, but Finn kicks him. He begins flying away. Well... maybe not today... or tomorrow... but another day! Another—Accidentally knocks head on door frame. He grunts in pain as he exits."
"Scene cuts to a dining room in the castle. Finn, Jake, and Bubblegum are eating spaghetti."
Princess Bubblegum says  Thanks again for saving me... again.
Finn says  Mouth full Don't mention it.
"Princess Bubblegum says  Now that Ricardio's gone, you don't have to be jealous of anyone anymore. Winks"
Finn says  I never get jealous.
"Princess Bubblegum says  Romantically Kiss me, Finn. Finn blushes, astonished. Ahem. She is doing a hand-stand and wearing a Jake mask on her posterior. She uses a deeper voice. I mean... kiss me, Finn. Normal voice, whispering Am I doing it right, Jake?"
Jake chuckles.
Finn says  NOOOOOOOO!!!
Iris out
The episode begins at Iceberg Lake where Finn is lighting a flamethrower with a flambit
Finn says  Yeah! Laughs and torches an iceberg Yeah!
"The iceberg melts, exposing several objects inside"
Finn says  I found another bike and more computers. What do you got?
Jake says  I keep finding baby shoes!
Jake torches an iceberg with his flamethrower and exposes more baby shoes
"Jake says  WHAT THE HECK, MAN?! And they're all lefties! Sorry I'm not finding any loot."
"Finn says  Keep it together, chubby, because I think we found enough scrap to finish building our gauntlet dock; a dock that is also a gauntlet."
"Jake says  Aww. Building this gauntlet dock is hard, man. Hard work sucks."
"Finn says  Don't be lazy, Jake."
There's a bubbling noise coming from the lake behind Finn and Jake
Finn says  Huh?
Jake says  Incoming iceberg!
Finn says  Whoa! That one's huge!
Jake says  I got dibs! Ooo. I hope it's not baby shoes.
"Jake wipes the surface of the ice, which reveals a face within the ice"
Jake says  Gasps It's a guy.
Finn says  Creepy. It's a buncha guys.
Jake says  You know what they remind me of? Well-dressed pickles.
"Finn says  Stand back, Jake! I'm gonna melt 'em outta there! Full charge."
Finn blasts a huge flame out of his flamethrower and Jake runs up to stop him
"Jake says  Whoa, don't roast 'em, man. You gotta flambé."
Jake gently brushes the flame across the iceberg and it soon melts
Jake says  Ah. Perfecto. Bon appetit.
Finn says  Hey! Can you hear me? Hello?
Jake says  Knocking on one of their heads I don't think they made it.
Finn says  Hey. Reaching for a briefcase This one's got some kind of pack.
One of them comes to life and pushes Finn away; Finn screams
Red-tie businessman says  I remember... business.
Finn says  Let go! Let go! Let go!
Red-tie businessman says We... are Business Men.
"Finn says  Oooh... Well, I'm Finn and he's Jake."
Jake says  What kind of business do you do?
"Red-tie businessman says  Been frozen... so long, I... The businessmen all shake their heads, as if in pain can't remember. Can't remember! Oh. Looking for help, your business? We love work for you."
Finn says  Nah. Adventurers don't need any help.
Jake says  Yes! Help us fix that dock.
Red-tie businessman says  Dock-ka?
Jake says  Yeah! Right over there.
Red-tie businessman says  Yes. This dock-ka... could be more... efficient.
Finn says  No! Wait!
The businessmen reel back and murmur as if frightened
"Finn says  Jake, this dock is our fun pie. We should be the ones to bake it."
"Jake says  But they're begging for it, Finn. Just look at 'em."
The businessmen look excited and several of them are drooling
Businessmen says  Murmuring Build dock. Build dock.
Jake says  Finn. These poor souls are lost without jobs. We can't ignore their plight.
Finn says  Uhh...
"Jake says  To the businessmen Go on guys, fix it up!"
Businessmen says  Woo!
The businessmen murmur excitedly as they run over to the dock and begin building
Finn says  Well... they do seem really happy to do it.
"Jake says  Of course, man. They said they ""love work for you."""
Businessmen says  In unison Uhh... We finish.
The camera zooms out to show a completed gauntlet dock
Finn says  Whoa!
Jake says  Told ya so.
Finn says  Come on! Let's try it out!
"Finn and Jake run through the gauntlet dock, avoiding the traps and obstacles, while Finn screams excitedly"
"At the end of the dock, Finn and Jake jump into the water"
Finn says  Laughing Yeah! Woo!
"Jake says  Laughing Yeah! Woo! Panting See? If we hire them full time, they'll be back in business and we'll be able to focus on fun stuff. Everybody wins!"
Finn says  Maybe you're right.
"Jake says  To the businessmen You hear that, guys? Maybe I'm right!"
Red-tie businessman says  Really? Job? With... ad-ven-tur-ers?
"Jake says  Yeah, mans!"
The businessmen cheer and dance
"The red-tie businessman throws down his briefcase and chisels ""Fin sic &amp; Jake Adventuring Incorporated"" into the side"
"The scene changes to the Tree Fort where the businessmen are cleaning weapons, ironing socks and shining shoes"
Jake is playing a video game on BMO
Finn says  Feels weird doing nothing.
"Jake says  Relax, man. This is your day off."
Hot Dog Princess says From far in the distance Help! Somebody help!
"Finn says  Trouble, dude! Get your axe! I'll get my... wha?"
Red-tie businessman says  Adventure pack... ready for you.
"Finn says  Hey, thanks man."
"The scene changes to Finn and Jake running across the Grass Lands, weapons in hand"
"Finn says  I have to say, Jake. My sword is totally shiny and stinkin' sharp!"
Jake says  Uh huh.
"Finn says  Even my shoes feel different. Not only are they clean, I feel radder, faster, more... adequate."
Jake says  Cool!
"The businessmen are running behind Finn and Jake, writing notes"
A battle cube is chasing Hot Dog Princess
Hot Dog Princess says  Help!
"Finn says  Don't cry, Hot Dog Princess! Jake and I will fend off these battle cubes!"
The businessmen sit off to the side and continue to take notes while eating donuts and drinking coffee
"Finn and Jake begin to fight the battle cubes, which are flying around Hot Dog Princess' kingdom"
"The scene fades to a later time, where everyone is tired from fighting and Hot Dog Princess is taking a nap"
Finn says  Man. I'm getting tired.
"Jake says  Groan Me too. These cubes are... frickin' resilient. Hey, business dudes! Hold off these cubes so we can catch our breath?"
Finn says  Jake! They don't know how to fight.
"The businessmen run over, wearing armor and wielding weapons; they begin fighting the battle cubes while Finn and Jake rest"
Red-tie businessman says  Offering bottled water and orange slices Water. Orange slices. Help rehydrate.
"Red-tie businessman runs back into battle, shouting"
"Jake says  These guys are great, right?"
Finn says  I gotta admit... they are helping. Surprised Oh! I think I figured out how to defeat the battle cubes!
Jake says  That's 'cause you had time to rest your body and refresh your brain.
"Finn says  To businessmen Ok! We'll take it from here, guys!"
Jake says  Yeah! Good work.
Finn and Jake run towards the battle cubes; Jake roars and grows large
Finn says  Grab all the cubes together!
"Jake stretches his hands to become giant and clasps them together, grabbing all the cubes"
Jake says  Got 'em!
"Finn grunts and jumps into Jake's hands with a rope and ties all the battle cubes together into a single, large cube"
Finn says  It worked!
Jake throws the cubes off into the distances
"Finn says  Wake up, Hot Dog Princess. You're free."
"Hot Dog Princess says  Oh! Thank you, Finn and Jake! Especially you, Finn."
"Hot Dog Princess stands on her hind legs and puckers her lips, as if to give Finn a kiss"
"Finn rears back, disgusted"
Finn says  Whispering to Jake Ugh. She smells like old hot dog water.
Jake giggles and the red-tie businessman runs in between Finn and Hot Dog Princess to take the kiss instead
Red-tie businessman says  Whispering to Finn I take one for team.
"Finn says  This is awesome! You get a promotion, fella."
Red-tie businessman cheers and dances
"businessman says  Take one for team, too."
The other businessmen begin kissing Hot Dog Princess
The scene changes to the Tree Fort where Finn and Jake are playing BMO
Jake says  Oh... Lost again!
Finn says  Grabbing the controller My turn.
"Jake walks over to the businessmen, operating a large collection of wires and monitors"
Jake says  What's that?
Jake goes to the freezer and takes out a tub of ice cream
Red-tie businessman says  Hero vision monitor. Use satellite to tell us world problems.
"Jake says  Oh, wow. Anything going on?"
Red-tie businessman says  Just small things. You save stress for big thing.
"Jake says  Freakin' awesome, man."
Finn says  What are they doing?
Jake says  Takin' care of business.
Jake eats a scoop of ice cream and Finn plays the video game
"Finn says  Jake, hit me!"
Jake flings a scoop of ice cream into Finn's mouth
"Time passes, showing more and more empty ice cream tubs stacked near Finn and Jake while both of them are getting fatter and fatter"
Video game says  Mission complete.
Jake says  Yeah!
"Finn and Jake get up and dance around, shaking their enormous guts"
Finn says  We beat Adventure Master!
Jake says  Holy moly!
Finn says  We're adventure masters!
Jake says  Woo! Yes!
Finn and Jake both get tired and stop celebrating to take a breath
Finn &amp; Jake says  Tired Ooo.
Finn says  I never knew being fat and lazy was so rewarding.
Jake says  Yeah. pushing around Finn's gut You're gut's so huge and moldable.
Finn says  Hey!
Jake says  Hold on a sec!
"Finn says  Laughs Man, that tickles."
Jake manipulates Finn's gut to look like the Ice King
"Jake says  Impersonating Ice King's voice I'm the Ice King, and I'll never find a bride because I'm such a tool."
"Finn says  Laughs Alright, let me try."
Finn manipulates his gut to look like Princess Bubblegum
"Finn says  Impersonating Princess Bubblegum's voice I'm Princess Bubblegum and I'm a dork, because I like science! I've also got a really annoying voice that Finn thinks is attractive!"
"Jake says  Laughs That's a- Hey, what'd you say?"
"Lumpy Space Princess says On a hero vision monitor, running from a Swamp Giant Ahh! Oh, my gosh! Leave me alone. All I said was ""you're ugly,"" which is totally true. Somebody help me! Oh no!"
"Jake says  Man, I am not in the mood for saving Lumpy Space Princess."
"Finn says  Hey, business dudes!"
The businessmen enter the room from various directions
Finn says  What do you guys think?
Red-tie businessman says  Hmm... Just one monster. We do.
The businessmen run off
"Jake says  Right. We'll just save our strength for the big adventures, then."
Finn and Jake sit back down on their couch and relax
"Jake says  Ahh. Nice call, dude."
Finn says  Imagine how awesome the adventure's going to be when it's time for us to go out there.
"Jake says  I'm too tired to imagine stuff, but I bet you're right."
Finn &amp; Jake says  Both grabbing a tub of ice cream and toasting with them To being great adventurers!
"They both begin eating ice cream; time passes and shows that they have empty tubs and ice cream all over their faces. They are even fatter, and Finn's gut is now visible outside his shirt"
Finn and Jake both groan and waiver until they fall over
"Finn says  Oh, gosh."
A voice in the distance says  Help us!
Finn says  Huh? Jake! Did you hear that?
Jake says  Yeah. Let the businessmen handle it.
A voice in the distance says  Help! Please!
Finn says  I heard it again.
"Jake says  businessmen, dude."
A voice in the distance says  Heeeeeelp!
"Finn walks over to the window and gasps, seeing the businessmen in a large robot, sucking up Fuzzy Friends into a container"
Red-tie businessman says  Through a PA system Woo-hoo! Woo!
"Finn says  Jake! We messed up! The businessmen have gone bat-crazy, dude!"
"Jake says  Still lying on the floor Man, just let the businessmen handle it."
"Finn says  THE BUSINESSMEN ARE THE PROBLEM, you lazy plug-hole!"
"Jake says  Opens his eyes, surprised Huh?"
Finn says  Yelling out the window Guys!
Finn begins to climb out the window and down to the bottom of the Tree Fort
"Finn says  Guys, stop it!"
"Finn says  Running up to the businessmen's robot Stop it, guys!"
"Red-tie businessman says  Stop what, boss?"
Finn says  You're jacking up those Fuzzy Friends!
"Red-tie businessman says  But... We're being heroes. Like you, boss. We're protecting them. Collecting them in our care-sack so they cannot be hurt. It's the most efficient way to save people."
Finn says  But you're making them unhappy!
Red-tie businessman says  Irrelevant! These people are in our care-sack. Their happiness is not priority.
Finn says  I am your boss! And you guys are all fired!
The businessmen begin to murmur to each other
Red-tie businessman says  Fi-red?
The businessmen shout angrily and start sucking up the Fuzzy Friends even faster than before
They move their robot and it crushes one of the Fuzzy Friends
"Finn says  Nooo! Alright, guys. Now I've gotta take you down... Finn style."
"Finn runs over to kick their robot, and gets sucked up into the care-sack"
"Finn says  I'm kicking your care-sack, dudes!"
Jake says  Finn? Whoa... Crud.
Jake squeezes his enormous gut out the window
Jake says  I'm comin' buddy!
"Jake flops onto the ground, still holding a tub of ice cream"
"Jake says  Ahh. I'm so fat, dude; I don't know what to do."
Finn says  Gasp That's it! Jake! Demoralize them!
Jake says  What? Why?
"Finn says  Do it, man! I have a legit plan!"
"Jake says  Ok, Alright. To businessmen Hey! You guys are horrible at business!"
"The businessmen lash about angrily and try to suck Jake up into their care-sack, but he's too fat to fit"
"Jake says  Huh? They're sucking me up, dude!"
"Finn says  Now, eat that ice cream some more to become fatter, while also using your Stretchy Powers to grow huge!"
Jake chows down on the ice cream and starts getting bigger
Jake says  lifting his head up for a second Ok!
Jake uses his Stretchy Powers as he gets pulled into the robot
Jake says  This sucks.
"Finn says  Yeah, dude! Keep growin'! You're breaking apart their robot!"
"The robot begins to shake violently, the businessmen scream"
Jake says  Oh no!
"The robot explodes and Finn, Jake and the businessmen go flying into the air"
"Red-tie businessman says  Attempting to grab Finn I'm going to kill you, not-boss!"
"Finn says  Wait, man! Wait! I wanna re-hire you guys!"
Red-tie businessman says  Re-hire? Really?
"Finn says  Yeah, mans."
Businessmen says  Woo hoo!
"As they all fall back to the ground, the businessmen and Finn grasp hands and form a five-point star"
"The scene changes to a beach, where Finn, Jake and the Fuzzy Friends are waving towards the water"
Fuzzy Friends says  Yay! Hip-hip hooray! Pancakes!
The businessmen are once again frozen in an iceberg and float back out to the middle of the lake
"Jake says  So, wait... What'd you hire them to do?"
Finn says  I hired them to stuff themselves in that iceberg and get outta here.
Jake says  Sigh I'm gonna miss 'em. And I'm gonna miss this gut.
Jake uses his Stretchy Powers to return to his normal size
Finn says  Laughs I'm gonna miss my gut too.
"Finn strains and attempts to suck in his gut like Jake, but it doesn't disappear"
Finn says  Huh? Aww...
"The episode ends with a stark close-up of Finn's frowning face with ""The End"" on it"
Finn and Jake are fighting a shark and Science Cat in front of their house.
Jake says Pussy cat! Come here!
The science cat throws a potion on him that turns Jake into a butterfly.
Jake says  Hey!
The cat begins to chase Jake.
Jake says  Help!
Finn says Don't worry! His spells never last long.
Jake says  Who are these guys? This is a great fight!
Finn says  Yeah! You never fought them? They come out every day at four o’clock on the dot.
Jake reverts to his normal form.
Jake says I guess that's because I meet Lady Rainicorn every day at four o'clock on the dot. Oh shoot! I'm late!
"Finn says  You should stay, man. At five o'clock every day, I chop both their heads off, and they grow them back for the next day."
"Jake says  Aw, man, that sounds awesome! I do want to stay and fight those guys, but I also want to hang out with my girlfriend."
Finn says  Boo!
"Jake says  sighs I should probably go. I'll see ya later, buddy. Jake rides off in his bike."
Finn says  Bye! Hyaaaaaaaaah! Finn charges at the Shark and Science Cat.
Jake says  sighs Oh!
Jake rides up to Lady Rainicorn's house and climbs up onto the roof with Lady Rainicorn.
"Jake says  Sorry! Sorry I'm late. Finn and I were fighting this shark and science cat, and I lost track of time. Anyway, I’m here now, M'lady, and I have brought to you half an orange."
Lady Rainicorn and Jake eat their orange.
"Lady Rainicorn says  Ooh! 고마워! ""Thanks!"" A beam from her horn hits a tree and turns it blue."
Jake says  Nice! Now make that green! Lady turns the river green.
"Jake says  giggles Ha ha ha! Yeah, that's good."
"Lady Rainicorn says  yawns 자러 가야겠다. "" I may have to go to sleep."""
Jake says  Sleep! But we were supposed to play viola together!
"Lady Rainicorn says  미안해. ""I'm sorry."" Kisses Jake on the head. 니가 늦게 왔잖아. ""It's because you came late."""
Jake says  sighs Yeah. Sorry again for coming so late.
"Lady Rainicorn says  잘 자. ""Good night.""  Jake"
Jake is riding home on a path through a forest on his bike with his viola in the basket.
Shelby says Pops out of the viola. Hi Jake.
"Jake says  Oh, hey, Shelby."
Shelby says  Why you looking so down in the dumps?
Jake makes a kind of deflating noise.
"Shelby says  No response, huh? Guess you're good."
"Jake says  I'm fed up, Shelby!"
Shelby says  Hmm?
"Jake says  Whenever I hang out with Lady Rainicorn, I miss out on fun times with Finn."
"Jake is using hand gestures to add emphasis, but he is riding a bike so he keeps swerving."
"Jake says  And then when I hang out with Finn, I'm missin' out on Lady Rainicorn! He lifted his hands in the air and he crashes into a tree. Oh!"
"Shelby says  Popping out of the viola again. Hey, Jake, why don't you just hang out with both of them at the same time?"
"Jake says  Jake props himself up, throwing the leaves off. And then I won't miss anything! Shelby! My problems are solved."
"Screen wipes to Finn, Jake, and Lady Rainicorn having a picnic by a fire pit."
"Jake says  Ah, isn't this great? This is totally great. To Finn Isn't it?"
Finn says  Yeah.
Jake says  To Lady Rainicorn Isn't it?
"Lady Rainicorn says  맞아. ""You’re right."" Jake laughs deeply."
Finn says  Excitedly What? What did she say?
Jake says  She said she also thinks it's great.
Finn says  Oh.
Jake says  Yeah.
Silent pause.
"Jake says  Hmm... Jake crawls up in front of them. Hey, did you know that you both have an awesome sense of humor?"
Finn says  We do?
Jake says  Yeah! Anybody have a joke?
"Finn says  Oh, I have a joke! Laughs. Okay, laughs okay. Knock knock."
"Lady Rainicorn says  누구세요 ""Who's there?"""
"Jake says  She said, ""who's there?"""
Finn says  Diarrhea!
"Jake says  쟤가 설사래. ""He said ""diarrhea."""
"Lady Rainicorn says  어, 나도 들었어. 뭐야, 하나도 재미없잖아. ""Oh, I got it too. What was that? It hardly qualifies as a joke."" Sips drink"
Finn says  Did she say diarrhea who?
"Jake says  Uh, no. No, she didn't say, ""diarrhea who?"" She didn't... say it. Lady, how 'bout you tell a joke?"
"Lady Rainicorn says  글쎄.. 뭐가 있었을까? 아! 우리 완전히 다 벗고 상추밭 미친듯이 뛰어다닌 거 기억 나? Jake and Lady Rainicorn giggle 그 농부 아저씨 완전 맛이 갔었지! ""Maybe... What could it have been? Ah! Do you remember when we got completely naked, and frantically ran around in the farmer's cabbage patch? Jake and Lady giggle That farmer got crazy mad!"""
Finn says  What's the joke?
"Jake says  Uhh... well, the joke doesn’t translate very well."
"Finn says  Man, I- I might leave. Is it okay if I leave? I kind of want to go fight something."
"Jake says Noooo! Don’t leave. Gets up to pace. If there was only some way you two could talk to each other directly. Pause Oh, dude! I just remembered! There's a universal translator device at the bottom of Lake Szelezon!"
Finn says The lake guarded by evil Lake Knights?
"Jake says  Yeah, I can't remember why I threw it in there. Let's all go and get it!"
"Finn says  Whoa Runs towards Jake whispers Jake! You’re inviting Rainicorn? No offense, but isn't she a little too sweet for deadly adventure?"
"Jake says  Trust me, Finn, she’s the Rowdy Queen. She can do anything!"
Finn says  Hmmm. Alright! Trust pound!
The camera shows them fist pounding and then the Adventure Time logo spins from in between their fists.
Finn is riding Jake towards the lake with Lady flying beside them.
They get to the lake and Lady turns them blue with her horn.
Finn says  Underwater camouflage!
They are shown swimming down into the lake. Finn points towards a group of lake knights and the fight starts
Finn fends off a few and Jake grabs a bunch and punches them. Lady attacks a few and Finn is seen strangling one knight when he notices the treasure at the bottom of the lake. He throws aside the dead lake knight and swims towards it. He grabs the translator and gives a thumbs up to Jake and Lady. Jake is Giving a thumbs up back when the lake starts rumbling. Finn is shocked when knights begin surrounding him from the crevasse surrounding the treasure. They overcome Finn and Jake is distracted by a couple while Lady runs down and knocks them away from Finn by spinning around. Finn rides Lady past Jake and out of the lake.
They shout in victory.
Finn says  Lady! You are incredible! You should adventure with us all the time!
Jake says  chuckles All according to plan.
"Lady Rainicorn says  고마워, 나도 재밌었어. ""Thanks, I enjoyed it too."""
"Finn says  Uhhh, what?"
"Jake says  Runs up to them Here's the translator. He puts the translator around Lady's neck Let’s see here. Turns on the device and switches through the options The voice options are... Old man, nerdy alien, ooor nightmare? He has it switched to nightmare Try sayin' something, toots!"
"Lady Rainicorn says  Makes scratchy, grungy noises Jake looks disturbed and goes to change it to old man... and then I ate all the peaches in the orchard, and that farmer was sooo angry!"
Finn says  Laughs I like this voice!
"Lady Rainicorn says  Jake switches it to nerdy aliens Lady makes some gurgley, indistinguishable noises  Finn laughs again Jake switches it back to old man...and that's the end of my story."
"Jake says  sighs Well, at least with old man option we can understand him, I MEAN HER! I mean you, sugar!"
Lady Rainicorn says  Hop on my back and I'll give you a ride home!
Finn says  laughs Whatever you say grandpa! Flips onto her back Hai-yah!
Lady Rainicorn says  Come on my darling. Wrap your legs around me.
Jake says  sighs I remember why I drowned that translator now.
Screen wipes to Finn and Jake riding on Lady's back over a forest
"Finn says  Hey grandpa, how are you able to fly if you don't have wings?"
"Lady Rainicorn says  Well, light travels from the sun. Then bounces off of our planet and then back into our eyes so we can perceive color."
Jake says  Whoa! Being bounced by Lady’s wavy flying style
Lady Rainicorn says  My body can intercept that light and dance around on it. Jake is sliding off of her
Jake says  Lady! It's a little rocky in the back seat here!
Finn says  laughs Shmow! Screen cuts to the Forest Wizard giving away rings That forest wizard is giving away free power rings!
Lady Rainicorn says  Do you wanna try gettin' some Finn?
Finn says  Yeahs! Lady dives down towards the clearing
Jake says  Flies off Lady’s tail end Laaaadyyy! Falls towards the forest Fiiiiinn! Turns into a flat hang glider-like object Lady! Floats down into the trees and onto the ground He gets up Lady! Finn! He grows huge and shouts above the trees Y'all around here? Looks around Dang it! Turns to see fireworks coming from the trees accompanied by the sounds of Lady and Finn having fun with the rings
"Screen cuts to Finn, Lady, and some animals cheering for the wizard"
Finn says  While the forest wizard does tricks and the small animals cheer Whoa! Did you see that!? This is like the funnest thing ever!
Jake says  Burst through the trees and scares everyone away There you are! Shrinks down Where were you guys?
"Finn says  Wait a minute, you didn't fly down with us?"
Lady Rainicorn says  We thought you were behind us the whole time!
Jake says  Noooo! Looking sad I fell off your tail end! Turns and looks mad I was shouting your name!
"Lady Rainicorn says  Comes up and nudges him Ooh! Honey pot, we probably couldn't here you because of the cloud density."
Finn says  Jake! Check out these power rings! The rings each expel some sort of magical display
Jake says  Whoa. That's cool! You got ten of them?
Finn says  Yeah! Lady got some too.
"Jake says  Lady shows Jake her rings Oh, that’s cool."
"Finn says  Uh, You want one of mine? I’ve got so many."
Jake says  Yeah! Thanks man!
"Finn says  Oh. Wait, I can't take them off. I guess they're cursed. Shoots blue flames from his fingertips Still pretty cool though."
"Jake says  Yeah, they're awesome. Depressed"
Screen wipes to Finn and Jake's house at night. Jake is sitting on the couch while Lady and Finn play a racing game
Finn says  Jake takes a sip of his drink Finn and Lady laugh Alright this time I’m gonna destroy you Rainicorn!
"Lady Rainicorn says  Oh, okay. Jake starts walking up from behind them That sounds nice."
Finn says  Oh I got the sword!
"Jake says  Hey, Lady, you wanna go play music together or somethin'?"
"Lady Rainicorn says  Oh, oh. Uh, I would, but I-I'm in the middle of this game."

Finn says  Then come on.
Jake says  No YOU go ahead! In a harsh tone And YOU have fun with MY girlfriend!
"Finn says  Uhhh... Jake sighs We're gonna head to the party, but you should meet us there and stop acting weird. Finn walks away"
Jake says  Finn and Lady are seen flying away outside the window sighs
Screen wipes to Jake sitting by pictures of him and Lady and him and Finn
"Jake says  sighs Looks over at a Finn-and-Jake-timeless clock, it is 11 says50. They should be back by now! He grabs his headset phone and dials the Cloud Kingdom."

"Cloud man says  Yeah, they left a while ago."
Jake says  A while ago?!
"Jake says  Jake bursts through the front door on his bike, looking around frantically. He looks startled. What the-! He stops on the hill overlooking Lady's house to find Finn and Lady hanging out without him, changing the color of things like he and Lady used to do."

Everyone laughs and the episode ends.
The episode starts in Marauder Village where two Marauders are refilling their mugs
Squid Bartender says  You guys sure you want another round of squid ink? Laughs
Two Marauders drink their mugs and then one smashes his over the other's head.
Head Marauder says  The camera pans to show many marauders rough-housing in pairs. Then it shows Finn and the Head Marauder fighting. You're not too bad for a human boy!
Finn says  Not too bad!? I'm better than that! Hears Mountain Man crying PausesHuh? Throws the Head Marauder out of the way Jake! Do you hear that?
Jake says  He is riding a bucking half-stag half-marauder What'd you say? Whoa! Gets tossed and then kicked over to Finn
Finn says  I think someone's crying. The Head Marauder jumps Finn Stop! Knocks the Head Marauder off This is serious! I gotta go find out where that crying is coming from! Begins to walk away
Head Marauder  says  Get back here you chickeeeen!
Marauders says  Ohhhhhhhh! Backing up the Head Marauder
Finn says  Turns around What did you call me?
Head Marauder  says  You can't just walk away from a roughhouse!
Finn says  Jumps on top of a table Hey! Listen up you cold-hearted marauders! Someone's out there crying for help and I'm not gonna ignore that!
Jake says  Awwww here it comes! Lay it down Finn!
"Finn says  A long time ago when I was a baby, I went boom boom on a leaf. Boom! Boom! Flash back shows baby Finn going boom boom on a leaf And I fell backwards and sat in my own boom boom. I cried for a day. But no one came to help me. A lady bug lady and her child walk past as the mother covers its child's eyes That day I vowed to help anyone in need! No matter how small their problem. Flash back ends And that's why I need to go. Runs off"
"Jake says  The Head Marauder starts to clap and the others follow He still cries when he poops. Thanks for being cool guys. Wait up, Finn! Boulders are rolling down the mountains Mountain Man is crying It's comin' from up there!"
"Finn says  Someone must be caught in that avalanche! Let's get it on! Finn hops on Jake's back and he stretches them to the top, avoiding boulders So, who's crying?"
Mountain Man says  I am.
"Finn says  Whoa! Aww, what's wrong fella? You cryin' boulders?"
"Mountain Man says  Yes, I am sad. Having been forced to watch roughhousing men for centuries."
Finn says  Ohhhh! I see. You're feeling left out and you wanna roughhouse too! Well I can take you on tough guy! Come on Jake! Back me up! Starts punch the mountain
"Jake says  Yeah, do it Finn! Hit 'im with a boulder! And then hit 'im with another rock!"
Mountain Man says  Please! No roughhousing! It…m-makes…me…soooo.. SAD! Boulders are launched from his eyes
Finn says  Huh? Why?
Mountain Man says  Because they're so rough on each other!
Finn says  With a slight stutter But a smooth well controlled roughhouse bolsters your guts and rejuvenate the muscle.
Mountain Man says  No! It's raunchy and maddening! All those men and their disgusting fantastic bodies!
Jake says  Whoa. This guy's got problems.
Finn says  gasp Flashback starts.
Ladybug kid says  Look mommy! Points at Finn
Ladybug Lady says  Honey! Don't look! That kid's got problems! Walks away as in the first flashback and Baby Finn cries badly. Flashback ends
Finn says  I'll help you mountain!
Jake says  Whoa! What?
Finn says  I'll stop those roughhousers from being rough!
Mountain Man says  Really? You'd do that for me?
Finn says  Yes sir! My name's Finn and I'm gonna help you out!
"Jake says  But Finn, we're not gonna shut down the roughhouse for real are we?"
Finn says  No way! But there's got to be some kind of solution. I’ll figure this out Mountain Man! Jumps off Mountain Man Yup!
Head Marauder  says  Aw! Finn! Ready to get destroyed?
"Finn says  N-nooo! Wait, um, actually, could you guys stop being so rough?"
Marauders says  What!? One marauder hits his head on a table
Head Marauder  says  Whoa whoa whoa! Waves off other marauders What are you talking about Finn?
Finn says  Could you guy just tone down the roughhousing a little?
Marauder says  What!? Hits head on table again
"Head Marauder  says  Whoa! Hey, hey. Shh. It's all right fellas. Finn, I'm sure this tone down the roughing thing has something to do with your boom boom, and I can respect that, but how can we POSSIBLY, make roughhousing, less rough?!"
Finn says  Sees a duck and rat to the side I think I have a perfect idea! Finn is seen tying several ducks to a marauders hand This'll soften your punches for smooth knock outs. Like punching a dream!
Marauder says  Head Marauder punches someone and the ducks quack Ha! Ha! Pigs on my knees! Pigs on my knees! Knees someone in the face and the pig oinks
Jake says  That’s like math. While fist bumping Finn
Finn says  Mathematical. On top of Mountain Man What do ya think? Fixed all youe problems right?
Mountain Man says  No! That was terrible! Now they’re just punching animals! It’s worse than before and it’s in no way a good solution!
Finn says  I’m sorry!
"Mountain Man says  Well you should be! It’s not fair to those animals and it’s not fair to me! I might just start to cry again, you know? Starts to cry again"
"Jake says  Aw, man."
Finn says  Come on Jake. I gotta give this another shot!
Jake says  Finn this guy seems like a real nut job. You know what I mean? I don’t wanna get sucked into this guy’s hang-ups.
Finn says  Yes I do Jake. That’s what I vowed! To help anyone in need! No matter how small their problem! Boom Boom At least I have to try brother.
Jake says  Jumps of Mountain Man with Finn So be it brother.
Finn says  Hey guys. I’m back. Marauders are roughhousing and ignore him Hey guys. Guys? Men! Men. Please stop a second. Men! Boys? Please? I have more to ask of you! Bros? My bros? Pets marauder Brother?
Marauder says  What? Did you just pet me? I’ll pet you! Pet pet! Heeeey! Pet pet. Hey this is great! Pets other marauder
Marauder says  Hey! Did you just pet me?!
Marauder says  Yeah! I did!
Marauder says  Well I’ll pet you back! Wha-whoa. What the-? This is awesome! Starts to pet each other
Finn says  Alright! This could be it! Finn goes around and spreads the petting addiction
Head Marauder  says  Finn! Laughs You're really mixin' things up in the best of ways today!
Jake says  Being petted by animals Maybe you can solve everyone's problems. Like a cherub with its bottom out.
"Finn says  Laughs Okay, cool. Hey, I'm gonna go tell the mountain."
Jake says  Alright I’m gonna- sighs stay here this time.
"Finn says  Mountain Man laughs So, everything's fine this time, right?"
Mountain Man says  Yes! Thank you Finn!
Finn says  back in the village So the mountain is totally fine with everyone petting. I feel great.
Jake says  Right on man! The marauders are going crazy over the petting! They're petting each other raw! Check ‘em out!
Finn says  The marauders look un happy whilst petting each other They look kinda rashy.
Head Marauder  says  Hey Finn! Hey man. As you can see the petting got sorta out of hand. Marauders pets him and he smacks his hand away Stop that! We are done with that! We’re going back to roughhousing!
Finn says  No wait fellas! The mountain doesn't like roughhousing.
Head Marauder  says  Well we don’t like not roughhousing! Ya see the problem here?
"Finn says  Well. Well what if we rotate the entire mountain 180 degrees around, so the mountain’s facing the other direction. That way, you guys can keep roughhousing and the mountain doesn't have to watch it!"
Head Marauder  says  Sounds fine with me!
Finn says  What do ya say mountain!
Mountain Man says  That’s okay. Only if you guys promise to stay healthy and not roughhouse after you rotate me.
Head Marauder  says  That mountain can talk?
"Jake says  Just promise him anything, he’s out of his gourd."
Head Marauder  says  Yeah! We’ll stay healthy!
"Mountain Man says  Oh! Thank goodness! Alright kids, spin me the math around!"
Finn says  Now I just need to set up some sort of pulley system.
"Mountain 2 says  No! Over here! Don’t turn him around! If you do, I’ll miss looking at his beautiful back! It’s gorgeous!"
Mountain Man says  Huh? What? Really!?
"Finn says  What!? A-but-ahh. Um, maybe what we can do is..."
Mushroom Creatures says  Excuse me. We need your help. There’s no music playing and we desperately want to dance!
"Finn says  Oh, ah just a second you guys. I’ll a- I’ll help you out in one minute."
Coal Man says  Hey! Pipe down over there! I want some peace and quiet!
Finn says  Let me just a-
Cactus Creature says  I need to be pollinated!
Finn says  Huh!?
Cactus Creature says  Pollinated all over to make my babies!

Mountain Man says  Freaking out What’s happening!
Finn says  Freaking out as well Ahhhhh! Everybody wants different things! And some of them want stuff that’s exactly the thing the others don’t want.
"Jake says  Whoa, dude. Hold on. So this guy wants this and that guy wants that, but man. What do you want? Flashback begins “What dooo yooou waaant?”"
"Joshua says  Want do you want baby? Picks up Finn Why are you crying? Margaret, this baby won’t tell me what’s wrong with it, and it’s stuck to a leaf, and it stinks."
Margaret says  Takes Finn Give it here Joshua. This baby needs love and kisses to be happy. Kisses Finn’s head several times and Finn starts laughing There. See? Now it’s happy.
"Joshua says  You just kissed a boom boom baby. So don’t expect any more sugar from me, sweetheart until we wash your dirty dirty face. Baby Finn laughs as he drools. Flashback ends."
"Finn says  gasps Hmm. Jake. What I want is to help anyone in need, so everyone is happy!"
"Jake says  Laughs Wow, that’s pretty corny man, but let’s do it dude! Wooohoo!"
Finn says  Holding megaphone Ready over there mushroom gang?
Mushroom Creatures says  Ready Finn!
Finn says  Ready dragon?
Dragon says  Yes sir!
Finn says  Ready Mountain Man?
Mountain Man says  Laughs…I’m ready.
Finn says  Go!
Fish says  The marauders begin roughhousing with strings attached to their limbs. The strings make several fans blow the flies off the fish's mother. As well as playing music Yay! The flies are leaving!
Coal Man says  The flies go and plug the coal man's ears Heh. Can't hear a thing! Throws to coal rocks onto two teeter-totters. This gives the toad back his plum and the Electroids back their triangle. They both cheer.
Cactus Creature says  The Mushroom Creatures hear the music and begin to dance in the flowers which the pollinate the cactus. Pollen! Here they come! She buds and the babies fall off

Mountain Man says  Radical.
Mountain 2 says  Shows Mountain Man's back to have a lake and river flowing down it And I can still see this gorgeous back!
Mountain Man says  Thank you Finn! You really helped everybody!
Jake says  Marauders lift up Finn and cheer Stop! I've got a problem.

"Finn says  Soooo, you don't suck blood?"
"Marceline says  Sometimes, I do. But it's not the blood that I like. It's the color. I eat shades of red."
"Sucks the red out of a strawberry, and gives it to Finn"
"Marceline says  Ugh, I am exhausted. I've been traveling all over the Land of Ooo. And I've seen some stuff that would really make you say ""like what?"""
Finn says  Like what?
Marceline says  I encountered a school of goldfish beasts. A flashback of Marceline riding giant goldfish
Marceline says  And I fooled around in the Fire Kingdom. A flashback of Marceline hula-hooping in the Fire Kingdom

"Marceline says Oh, these aren't ordinary nuts. Squeezes the nuts and they become little creatures. One squirts Finn with ink."
Finn says  laughs You're wonderful.
"Jake says  Um, yeah. Thank you for not sucking our blood."
"Marceline says  You guys seem cool, too, but as you can imagine, I'm really tired, so you two should probably get going."
Finn says  What?
"Marceline says  sighs Look. She uses psychokinesis and moves a picture frame and reveals an ""M"" carved into the tree ""M"" for ""Marceline."""
"Jake says  Aw, man."
Marceline says  I carved in this tree years ago. Way before you two rascals started squatting here. Flings them out
"Marceline says  But seriously guys, thanks for keeping the place warm for me, I mean really great!"

"Marceline sucks the red out of a crumpet, and throws it onto Finn"
Finn says  I'm gonna kill her.
"Jake says  Dude, if half the stories I've heard, and/or made up are true, vampires will kill you. There's no question!"
"Marceline hisses at them and then walks away, laughing"
"Finn says  But, what about our home?"
"Jake says  A VAMPIRE TOOK IT! Aw, we should go house-hunting. Bag us a new house."

"Finn says  I don't wanna hear a lecture, dude! I just wanna go home..."
"Jake says  singing But, home is where your heart is, Finn! And where is your heart, Finn? Well, it's right here inside you when I'm sitting here beside you! talking With your lucky stars to guide you from above. They look up, a star floats around, then poofs and disappears"
"Finn says  Yeah, I guess I'd rather be out here, wrapped in your ear, than be in some awesome house all by my... souse."
Jake says  I'd rather be dancing with some babes!
"Finn says  laughs Shut up, dude!"

"Finn says  Oh, yeah. Okay, Marceline, I'm gonna let you keep this cave, but only because Jake is my home, and he's way better than all your homes combined!"
"Marceline says  Ya know, you're right. I guess I'll take him too!"

Jake says  reluctantly Okay.
"Penny says  I have an idea! My mom used to tell me that there's a King of Thieves who lives in the center of the city, and everything that gets stolen from little girls ends up at his tower. Maybe we'd find my basket in his treasure chest!"
"Finn says  That's a great idea, Penny!"
"Penny says  There's one thing, though. The tower that he lives in is surrounded by a magical barrier. Which magically keeps thieves out."
"Finn says  Have you forgotten?! We three ain't thieves! We're pure! Right, Jake? Finn turns to look at Jake, but he isn't there. Jake?"

"Finn says  Sure. C'mon, let's go, Jake!"

"Finn says  Jake, where'd you get those boots?"
"Jake says  Huh, what? What boots? looks down Oh, no! I stole! The city! It took advantage of me!"
"Finn says  sighs Jake, you're a thief now! You won't be able to get in anymore!"
"Jake says  Yes, I can. runs up to the barrier and gets knocked back Oh. chuckles"
"Finn says  sighs It's up to me, now."
"Penny says  Legend says you'll find the loot in the King of Thieves' chest. Good luck, Finn! Oh, yeah, and that high window is the only entrance."

"Finn says  exiting the tower I got it, guys!"
Penny says  The chest! Gimme that! grabs the chest from Finn
Finn says  Huh?
Penny puts the chest down. She pulls out a black crooked knife.
"Jake says  Woah, woah, woah. Easy, kid."
"Penny opens the chest. Inside the chest are gold coins, jewels, a dagger and a Game Boy. She laughs maniacally."
Finn says  What?! stammering Is you basket under all that gold?
Penny says  Of course it's not! I set you up to steal this chest of gold! I couldn't get past the barrier 'cause I'm a thief!
Finn says  But you're just a cute little girl!
"Penny says  And, I'm a thief!"
"Finn says  Well, if this isn't yours, I'm gonna return it right now! closes the lid and starts to walk back toward the tower and gets knocked back Huh? puts hand and body against barrier, to no avail Why can't I...?"

"Penny says  You've become a thief, stupid! runs away with chest and laughs"
Finn says  looks at hands My hands. They're all dirty. Covered in the dust of a criminal act! I'm a thief!
"Suddenly, laughing is heard. Jake looks around for the source. Underneath him, the floor rises up and the Hag emerges."
"Hag says  Oh, what did I tell you, boy? This city will get you, no matter how pure you think you are! laughs I was right."
"Jake says  Hey, that's enough from you, Hag! puts feet around Hag's face and throws her away walks over to Finn Finn?"
"Finn says  Don't touch me! I'm impure, man! Unfit to be a hero! Unfit to be your friend."
"Jake says  Come on, Finn, keep it together!"
"Finn says  No, Jake. This is a one-way path, down a jacked-up road. And I gotta walk it... alone."
"Jake says  I'm not gonna leave you alone in the city. You're my buddy. Besides, I stole these boots. These super-big style boots. So I'm just as dirty as you are, Finn. We gotta walk this filthy path together!"
Finn says  Then we shall embrace the darkness of this wicked city and use the methods of the criminal to seek vengeance on Penny.
Jake says  Cowabunga! stretches into a cape for Finn
"Finn says  Cowabunga, indeed."
Finn and Jake start hopping over rooftops and into the house of the Short Goblin. They steal Crossbow Guy's crossbow from him and exit. They go into a different house with a crocodile in it and steal two swords. They also go into a house where a horse is showering. They steal the soap it was using and it whinnies.

Finn's shadow goes away and Penny returns to her inspecting. Finn and Jake's head comes down from the top of the tent and Finn quietly says ""Penny,"" who turns around at the sound of her name. She pulls her black crooked knife out."
"Finn says  off-screen It's me, Penny. The hero whose purity you stole! And I'm here to enact my revenge upon you! Jake flies over Penny, who squeals. Finn lands on the other side of the tent."
"Jake says  Hi, Penny."
"Penny says  Finn, please don't punch my lights out! I'm just a poor, homeless baby girl."

Finn says  She's purified!
Penny says  sparkles I feel...clean! Like all the filth of the city and wrongdoings are gone! Thank you F and J! I haven't felt like this since I was young!

Finn says  I just wanna see 'im put on that crown.
The frog walks through the bars of a locked gate.
Finn &amp; Jake says  Running towards the gate Wooow!
Jake says  It looks cool in there!
Finn says  Pointing to lock on gate Too bad we don't have the key to this.
Jake says  What're you talkin' about? Indicating his legs I got two keys right here!

Finn says  Whoo-hoo!
Finn and Jake land inside the garden.
Jake says  Wow! Look at this place!
Finn says  Jake. Are these donuts?
Jake says  They look like donuts.
"Finn says  But maybe they're poisonous donuts! Jake begins sniffing one of the donuts on the bush. Yeah! Sniff it, Jake! Suck up those toxins!"
Jake sniffs it thoroughly.
Jake says  Wait a second... I don't know what poison smells like.
Witch says  Hey! She strains towards Finn and Jake on her cane. Lifting her cane Razzamafoo!
She switches places with Finn and Jake.
Jake says  Hey!
Finn says  What gives?!
Witch says  You ate one of my donuts!
"Jake says  No, I didn't. I just sniffed it."
Witch says  RAAAAAGH!! You're lying! The stink of magic dog lips is everywhere!
"Finn says  Holy slug, lady! Calm down!"
"Jake says  Listen, Mrs. Witch."
Witch says  I never married!
"Jake says  Well, I never ate your donuts."
Witch says  You... you're eating one right now!
"Jake says  Mouth full No, I'm not! Noticing he is holding a donut Whoa-hoa! Hm... That's weird... I don't even remember grabbing this. My subconscious must be hungry, huh? Huh... whatever. Finishes donut"
Witch says  Convulses angrily MAGICUS NOMORICUS!
Jake says  Uh-oh. Gets blasted
"Finn says  AAH! The magic smoke makes him and Jake cough. Dude, are you okay?"
Jake says  Yeah... I think so. Just a little chilly. Noticing he is in his underwear WHOA!
Witch says  Ahahahahahehehe!
Finn says  What did she do to you?
Witch says  I stripped him of his magical powers!
Finn says  For stealing one of your billions of donuts?!
"Jake says  Yeah, it's not like I killed your husband or somethin'."
Witch says  Livid I AM NOT MARRIED!
Finn says  The point is you overreacted.
Jake says  And what gives? Pointing to his nipple I used to have like eight more of these things.
Witch says  The only way I'll give back your powers is if you admit your error and say you're sorry and mean it! ...'Cause I can tell the difference.
"Jake says  Well, you can forget it because you're the one who's wrong! To Finn ...Right?"
"Finn says  Total support, dude."
Witch says  Convulsing angrily RRRRAAAARRGH!! Waving her cane Go-backicus-from-whence-you-came-icus!
"Finn says  Aw, now you're just makin' these up!"
He and Jake disappear.
"Witch says  Rubbing one of the donuts Are you alright, my... my donut pretties? Heh heh... Wait a second. YOU'RE A BAGEL! LIARS! LIARS EVERYWHERE! The bagel becomes ""stripped."" Scene shifts to the Tree Fort."
"Finn says  There's gotta be a way to get your powers back! Where'd they come from, anyway? Were you born with them? Or... did you have a freak industrial accident?!"
"Jake says  Ha. That takes me back. Let me just... deep voice remember. A memory bubble appears above his head. I see a memory. When I was just a pupster... I'm rollin' around in a mud puddle, and I'm just... lovin's it. Oh, no! The bubble explodes. Jake pants from exhaustion. Whoo... Remembering is hard work."
Finn says  What happened next?!
"Jake says  Oh. Um... I went into the mud, and... I guess I became a magic dog?"
Finn says  Okay! Then our course is clear! We'll roll you in every mud puddle in Ooo until we find the one that'll restore your powers.
"Jake says  Lying down That's nuts, man. You got any idea of how many mud puddles are in the land of Ooo? Four? Maybe even five?"
"Finn says  Jake, come on! We've always been lucky, buddy! Maybe the first mud puddle we find will be the right one!"
Jake says  Nonsense... but I like it!
Finn says  Jumping out window Then away! Hyuh! Whoo-hoo!
"Jake says  Yeah, let's do it!"
Finn lands on his feet; Jake lands on his face with a thud.
"Finn says  Oh, my gosh!"
Jake says  I forgot that I don't have magic powers anymore. How do we search for the mud without my powers?
Finn says  We run! Run like energetic little boys! Finn runs quickly away.
"Jake says  To himself This whole time, I thought running was some sort of... leg magic. Jake begins trudging along. Before long, he gets tired. Huh... Look at me. I'm runnin'! Pants heavily; the camera gets ahead of him as he slows down. Oh, no... Thud; camera pans back to Jake. Out of breath Running... is... evil..."
"Finn says  Come on, lazy bones!"
Jake says  It's too hard!
Finn says  I guess you could ride on my backpack.
"Jake says  Straining I can't reach. Finn bends backwards; Jake grabs on to Finn's neck. You good, Finn?"
"Finn says  Choking You're... strangling me... a little, is all."
Scene transition to the River of Junk.
Finn says  Look there! Across the River of Junk! There's an ideal mud puddle.
Jake says  I'll stretch into a boat! Strains then farts I'm startin' to really miss that old magic of mine.
"Finn says  We can swim this river easy! Jumps into river Come on, Jake! Swims across, leaving Jake behind"
"Jake says  To himself Man, that looks exhausting."
A projection of Jake's subconscious appears on a piece of furniture in the river.
"Jake's subconscious says You're right, Jake. It is exhausting."
Jake says  Gasp What are you?!
Jake's subconscious says  I'm your subconscious!
"Jake says  Okay, what are you doing here?"
Jake's subconscious says  I'm here to tell you that what you're feeling deep down inside is true! It is way too hard to swim across the river. It's easier to wear a hat. Handing Jake a hat Here! Have a hat!
Jake says  Donning the hat Ha ha!
Jake &amp; his subconscious says  Yeah-hea-hea-hea! Heh heh!
"Jake says  Man, I'm glad I met you."
Finn says  Jake! Stop talking to yourself! Cross over already!
"Jake says  Uh, I can't swim that river, dude. My subconscious says it's too hard. Check out this hat, though."
Finn says  Growls What's wrong with that guy? To Jake Then just wait for me there!
"Finn dives down and begins gathering various things. When he grabs a trash can lid, a large eye is uncovered and it opens. Finn re-surfaces and begins building something, mumbling to himself and visibly annoyed. ""Ergh, stupid..."""
"Jake says  Whatcha workin' on, Finn? Finn continues constructing a catapult from the junk, still mumbling angrily to himself. ""... have to do everything!"" Look at you! Doin' stuff! Finn pulls down the catapult lever. Oh, is it a chair? Jake gets on the platform. A chair for my butt—? Finn releases the lever, launching Jake all the way to the other side of the river and into the mud puddle. Mud-venture!"
Finn says  Did it work?!
"Jake says  Oh, yeah! I can feel this workin'! In fact, you should roll in the mud with me, Finn! We can both be magic!"
Finn says  YEAAAAH! Joins Jake in the mud. They laugh and roll around in it. This isn't working at all.
Jake says  This isn't the right mud. I was just really hopin' this was over and done.
Finn says  Sigh Okay... Then let's just go find another mud puddle.
Jake says  Actually... I'm feeling kinda chubby-tired. Can't we do this tomorrow?
Finn says  Agh! This is stupid! Just go back to the witch and apologize and get your powers back!
Jake says  Never! I'd rather be powerless forever then apologize! I'm lazy but prideful.
"Finn says  Angrily YOU'RE NOT EVEN TRYING, MAN! Knocks Jake's hat off First, you won't run, Stuttering a-and now you keep—and... a-and no matter what, I ju—you..."
Jake says  Adventuring is too much hard work for a bro without his powers.
Finn says  But you are an adventurer.
"Jake says  Nah, from now on, I'm just your regular old dog. ...Ironic given my current man-baby body."
Something big emerges from the river; Finn and Jake gasp. A giant pile of junk emerges and a giant living fish skeleton pops out of it.
Gary says  Behold the beautiful mermaid of the river. Finn retches. Which one of you mortals wants to mate with Gesturing over her body all this? Heh heh heh...
"Finn says  Oh, um... How do I say, ""You're the grossest thing ever,"" without offending you?"
Gary says  RAAAAAARGH!!
Gary angrily conjures up a fireball.
"Jake says  I'll scare her off, Finn! Barks at her"
Gary blasts them but they evade.
Finn says  How do we beat power like that?!
Jake says  Finn! I've got an idea!
"Finn says  What is it, buddy??"
"Jake says  Rub my belly! Yeah, I'm one of those kinda dogs."
Finn growls angrily.
Finn says  Charging Gary YAAAAH!
"Gary evades his attack and spits a black substance on him, knocking him out. Gary cackles."
"Jake says  Finn? Gary takes him to her nest. Finn! Come on, Finn! You gotta save yourself! I'm just a dog! Aw, man. Oh, geez... Okay. Then I'm back on the team! Attempts to climb tree I'll save you!"
Finn says  Jake? Giant eggs around him are beginning to hatch.
"Jake says  Don't worry! He fails to climb the tree. Hey, Finn... Can you help me to get up there?"
The Hatchlings hatch.
Hatchlings says  Hungry! Hungry! Hungry!
Jake says  Desperate noise If only I had my powers back!
Witch In Jake's memory says  The only way I'll give back your powers is if—
"Jake says  I know, I know! I have to apologize to that Witch."
Scene transition to the Witch's garden. The Witch is planting a cupcake.
"Witch says  To cupcake Oh, you're doing so well... and I hate you so much!!"
"Jake says  At gate Hey! He's straining to get past the gate, but he's too fat. Witch! I need my powers back! So I'm sorry! I'm so sorry I ate your donut!"
Witch says  Razzamafoo.
Jake appears in front of the Witch.
Jake says  Straining sounds ...Oh. Stops straining So do I get my powers back?!
Witch says  Mmm... Apology denied.
Jake says  What?! Why?!
Witch says  Because you took too long. Now you have to apologize while doing a variety of humiliating things.
"Jake says  No way, Jose!"
"Jake's subconscious says  Come on, dude. It's the only way to save Finn."
Witch says  Who is that?!
Jake says  He's my subconscious.
Witch says  Then he has to do it too.
Jake's subconscious says  Aw...
Scene transition. Jake is dancing with his subconscious with flowers in his underwear.
"Jake says  I, Jake the dog, while slow-dancing with my subconscious, with flowers in my underwear, do humbly apologize..."
"Witch says  Starts shooting with video camera Wait, wait. Start over."
Jake says  You're recording this?!
Witch says  It's for my newsletter.
Jake says  No way. I have my dignity.
"Witch says  Then guess what, cool guy? You can forget about getting your powers back... EVER!!"
"Jake says  To his subconscious Oh, no, dude! What do we do now?"
His subconscious starts coughing and falls over.
"Jake's subconscious says  I'm dyin', Jake."
Jake says  Wha?!
Witch says  Hm. He says he's dying. Let that be a lesson to all you cupcakes. Trembles Hah...
"Jake says  Why are you dying, bro?"
"Jake's subconscious says  Because... I'm the subconscious of your old magical self. Coughs Goodbye, Jake..."
Jake says  No! No! Starts crying
Witch says  So I've finally broken you.
"Jake says  Yeah! Sobs If only... I were a humbler guy, my subconscious would be alive, and my best bud wouldn't be trapped in a mermaid's nest!"
"Witch says  YES! GLOAT, GLOAT, GLOAT! Alright, I think you've learned your lesson. Kindly I forgive you."
Jake regains his fur.
Jake says  Magically stretching his arms My powers! How can I ever thank— Swipes her magic cane away Ha! Got your cane!
"Witch says  WHAAA! OOF! Falls over Jake grabs yet another donut and eats it. His subconscious, now well, gets on his back and they both flee. But didn't you learn your lesson?!?"
Jake says  NOPE!!! He and his subconscious laugh.
Scene transition back to the nest. Finn wakes up.
Hatchlings says  Hungry! Hungry!
Finn screams.
Gary says  Remember to save the brain for dessert.
The Hatchlings move towards Finn. Finn trembles in terror.
"Jake says  Honey, I'm back! How about a big kiss? Jake kisses her with great force, knocking Gary back into the river. To Hatchlings, in a cutesy voice You guys are so cute! I could just maul you to death!"
The Hatchlings run away.
Finn says  Jake! Hugs Jake's face I never should have doubted you!
"Jake says  Well, I'm glad you learned your lesson says that in a crunch, there's nothin' I wouldn't do for ya."
"Finn says  Ahhh, so is that how you got your powers back? You apologized to the witch?"
Jake says  Uh... Sweats profusely No way! I must have found the right... mud puddle! Yeah... I don't remember. Heh... eh-heh... Blabbers lips with relief as the episode ends.
"Pat McHale says  In the dark recesses of the mind, a disease known as FEAR feasts upon the souls of those who cannot overcome its power..."
Finn and Jake chase a Fire Newt to the ocean
"Finn says  Come back, thief!"
The Fire Newt spews fire at Finn and Jake
Jake says  Whoa!
Fire Newt says  Stop farting on me! It's gross!
Finn says  You can't just go around stealing boots.
"Jake says  Yeah, and you know the penalty for stealing boots. It's poots... on newts."
Both says  Laugh
The Fire Newt wades into the ocean to avoid Finn and Jake
Finn says  He's getting away in that lake!
"Jake says  Dude, that isn't a lake. That's an ocean."
"Jake stretches and heads towards the ocean, a poot following behind, barking"
Finn says  Laughs and runs after Jake Bark! Bark! Bark! Bark! ...Huh?
The hue of the ocean and sky changes to red and ominous music plays as a wave crashes
Finn backs away from the water as it washes onto land
Finn says  Uhh...
Jake says  Laughing and farting on the Newt Poots on newts! Poots on newts!
Fire Newt says  No!
Jake says  Slow-motion Poots on newts!
"Finn says  laughs and starts removing his shoes I'm coming, Jake. I'll poot on that newt as soon as I'm barefoot. Uh..."
The ocean turns a red hue again and ominous music plays as a wave crashes
Finn gasps and rapidly crawls away from the water
"Finn says  Breaths heavily, his stomach rumbles Ow! Why is my stomach going nuts?"
A black smoke rises out of Finn's navel
Finn says  Ow!
The smoke forms into a face and laughs
Finn says  Wh-wh-wh-Who are you?
Fear Feaster says  I am the manifestation of your fear... fear of the ocean!
"Finn says  What? I'm not afraid of lakes, wells, or rivers, streams, or deep wells or puddles. Why would I be afraid of- Screams and backs away from the water"
Fear Feaster says  Laughs 'Cause you're a wuss.
Finn says  I'm no wuss! I'm the hero around these parts!
Fear Feaster says  Ha! You're too scared of the ocean to ever be a true hero.
Finn says  Not true! I'm not scared of nothin'!
"Finn charges towards the ocean, screaming, but stops when he sees a wave crash"
Finn says  Shakes his head and takes a deep breath I shall conquer my fear.
"Fear Feaster says  Yeah, right."
Finn says  No! I will. I'll conquer my fear.
"Fear Feaster says  Of course you will, Receding back into Finn's navel and I live in a two bedroom apartment that doesn't smell like vomit Laughs ...Sarcasm."
"Jake says  Dude. Dude, did you see me? I was all like womp, and then I was all like take this! Womp! Womp! And then... Hey, what’s wrong with you, dude?"
Finn says  Jake. I think I'm afraid... of the ocean.
"Jake says  Say what, now?"
Finn says  I need your help to overcome my fear. Will you do it?
Jake says  Um... No... I don't really wanna do it.
Finn says  Jake! Come on!
"Jake says  I'm just messing with you. I'll do it. Hmm... Where to start? Oh, ok. I think we should just take a few steps in the water. You can hold Jake's hand if you're scared."
"Jake grabs Finn's hand and starts walking towards the water, but Finn doesn't walk and falls over"
"Jake says  Um... Oh it's ok, dude. I see the problem. It's just your feet."
Jake walks over to Finn's feet and takes his shoes off
Jake says  Manually moving Finn's feet forward one at a time Boop. Beep. Boop. Beep. Boop. Beep. Boop. Beep. Beep. Boop. Beep. Boop.
Finn says  Don't be scared. I shall not be scared.
Jake says  Still moving Finn's feet Boop. Boop.
The water touches Finn's feet
"Finn says  I'm afraid! Ah! Jumps on top of Jake and starts punching him Jake, get me out of the water! Now, Jake! Now! Now!"
Jake inflates his head and walks Finn back to shore
"Jake says  Hot jam! You're really scared of the ocean. In fact, you're so scared... it gives me an idea. Let's start a business of being scared of the ocean!"
Finn says  Jake!
Jake says  Ok. Ok. I have a plan to get rid of your fear. We'll start tomorrow morning.
Finn says  But I must conquer this now! Runs towards the ocean screaming I'm not afraid of you!
Multiple waves crash directly in front of Finn in rapid succession and a single droplet hits Finn's face
Finn says  reels back in slow-motion and screams No!
Finn says  Running backwards I'm afraid of you! I'm afraid of you! Screams
"Finn says  Exhaustedly crawls to Jake's feet Ok, yeah. Let's try tomorrow."
The scene changes to Finn and Jake's bedroom where Jake is sitting on top of a sleeping Finn
"Jake says  Fiiiinn. Finn. Hey, Finn. Wake up."
"Finn says  Opens his eyes Morning, Jake."
Jake says  Ready for me to help you get over your ocean fear?
"Finn says  Yeah, man."
Jake says  Cool... but I can only do this if you ask me.
Finn says  I'm askin'!
Jake says  Then get ready for my three-step plan. Watch your troubles melt away with step one!
"Jake punches the bedroom wall and the entire structure breaks apart, leaving Finn and Jake floating on Finn's bed in the middle of the ocean"
"Finn says  Screams Jake, are you crazy? This is not an OK thing to do!"
"Jake says  Hey. Hey. Come on. The ocean is your friend, and you got friends all around you right now. Miles and miles of friends."
Finn says  You're nuts. Wriggles from side to side
"Jake says  Don't try to struggle, man. Pulls the blankets back, revealing that Finn is tied to the bed I'll let you out in a second. You just need to calm down."
Finn says  Really? Ok. I'm calming down.
Jake says  That's great. You're doing great. Ready for step two?
"Finn says  Breathing heavily Yeah, man. I can do it."
"Jake says  Alright, dude. Step... two! Unties the rope"
"The bed collapses and falls into the ocean, leaving Finn floating inside his sleeping bag and Jake on top of him"
"Finn says  Screams Jake, this isn't a joke! It's touching me!"
"Jake says  Let it hold you, man! Let it hold you like a child!"
Finn says  Heart pounding I'm trying to let it hold me.
Jake says  Control your breathing!
Finn says  Breathes in and out This isn't working!
Jake says  That means we gotta move to step three. Just don't scream.
Finn says  W-what?
Jake says  I'm gonna push you underwater with my jowls. Just don't scream. Don't scream.
Jake pushes Finn's head underwater
Finn says  What?!
"Jake says  Don't scream. Hold your breath, Finn. You got it, dude!"
"Finn screams and bursts out of his sleeping bag, sending Jake flying into the water"
Finn jumps onto Jake's head and starts pounding on him
"Finn says  Get me away, Jake! Now, Jake! Now! Right now! Get-Get me away! Screams"
"Jake says  Finn! Stop it, Finn! Ow!"
Finn grabs Jake's ears and stretches them until they catch wind and carry both Finn and Jake to an island of pre-war ruins
Finn says  Laughs I'm safe! I'm safe! How'd I do?
Jake says  I think we should give up.
Finn says  What? I made it all the way to level three.
"Jake says  Look, Finn. It's not that I don't want to help you... I just don't wanna get beat up anymore. I mean this Pointing to his face is my bread and butter. I can't have you messing up my bread and butter, dude."
Finn says  You have to help me. I can't do this without you.
Jake says  Ok. Fine... but only if you swear not to hit me anymore.
Finn says  I swear I won't hit you anymore.
Jake says  And also swear to only speak in rhymes. Speak in rhymes all the times.
Finn says  I swear... and pigs have hair.
Jake says  Yes. Perfect. And since you want more... it's time for step four.
Finn says  What? I thought you said it was a three step plan... man.
"Jake says  I'm not that good at counting. Laughs and grabs a small, rusty submarine Come on. Let's go kick your fear of the ocean where the sun don't shine... in the sea cucumber."
The scene changes to underwater where Finn and Jake are heading to the ocean floor in the submarine
"Jake says  Check it, dude. One hundred percent awesome-itude."
"Finn says  Eyes closed, breathes heavily and shivers Yeah. It's pretty math... you psychopath."
"Jake says  You know, it looks way more math if you open up your eyes."
Finn says  Opens his eyes Whoa...
"Jake says  See, man? The ocean is beautiful. There's no reason to be afraid of things that are beautiful."
Finn says  Hey. This isn't that bad. I'm actually glad.
"Jake says  Points Hey, look! A black abyss! Let's go check it out... sauerkraut."
"Finn says  No, Jake! Turn around! Turn around!"
Finn sees the Fear Feaster's face appear in front of the abyss
Finn says  Noooo!
"Jake says  Saying, ""Turn around"" twice doesn't count as a rhyme, dude."
Finn pushes Jake away from the submarine controls
"Jake says  Hey, you swore!"
Finn pummels Jake
Jake says  Ow! My bread and butter!
Finn grabs the controls and jerks them violently
"Jake says  No, dude! Don't!"
"The submarine moves wildly and launches torpedoes, one of which hits a building"
"The building topples and hits the submarine, causing it to start filling up with water"
"Jake says  Don't worry, dude. Everything's cool. This is the perfect segue into level five. Handing Finn a dive suit Here, put this on."
Finn starts putting on the suit
Jake says  Just make sure you don't pull the emergency tab.
Finn pulls the emergency tab
"Jake says  No, dude! I said don't..."
"Finn's suit expands rapidly and knocks Jake back, hitting his head against a valve and knocking him out"
Finn floats to the surface and watches Jake descend into the abyss along with the broken submarine
Finn says  Jake? Jaaaaaake!
Finn reaches the surface and jumps onto a buoy
Finn says  Jake!
Fear Feaster says  Laughs Pathetic! You can't even overcome your fear now that your friend is about to die! Your un-heroic body will never let you save Jake. Laughs
Finn says  Sadly You're right.
"Fear Feaster says  What? Really? You think I'm right? Well, that's... that's great!"
"Finn says  Holding a wrench If my body won't let me rescue my best friend, then there's only one thing left to do."
"Finn removes his helmet, hits himself on the head with the wrench and falls into the ocean"
Fear Feaster says  No. Wait. No! Noooo!
Finn lands on the ocean floor and wakes up next to Jake
Jake groans
Finn says  Jake! Jake! Wake up!
Jake opens his eyes
"Finn says  You ok, dude?"
"Jake says  Yeah, man. Wait... Finn, you did it! You conquered your fear!"
Finn says  What?
Jake says  You're at the bottom of the ocean!
"Finn screams and tries to pull his emergency tab, but nothing happens"
Jake says  Maybe we should celebrate on land.
"Jake grabs Finn and pulls his own emergency tab, so they both float to the surface"
Finn and Jake run onto the beach and fall backwards
Jake says  I'm proud of you man. You did it!
"Finn says  Thanks, dude."
Fear Feaster comes out of Finn's navel
"Fear Feaster says  You've nothing to be proud of, boy! You will never get of your fear of the ocean!"
"Jake says  Whoa, dude! What's with your bellybutton?"
"Finn says  To Fear Feaster What the flip, man? I just swam to the bottom!"
"Fear Feaster says  No you didn't, cheater! You just sank to the bottom. You will never be a great hero."
Finn says  He's right. I'll never be a hero.
Finn's stomach rumbles and a black-smoke limousine comes out of him and parks nearby
The limousine’s windows roll down and Three Wise Men come out
"Wise Man 1 says  Finn, you are wrong. The mark of a great hero is his flaw."
"Fear Feaster says  You know nothing, Wise Men!"
"Wise Man 1 says  Silence, Fear Feaster! We know a lot!"
Finn says  Wait... Why did you wait so long to tell me?
Wise Man 1 says  Because the limo driver's flaw is being late!
Limo Driver says Sorry. rolls up window
"Wise Man 1 says  Farewell, Finn. You truly are the greatest hero of Ooo."
The Wise Men go back inside the limo and then the limo drives back into Finn
"Finn says  It's time for you to go away, Fear Feaster!"
Fear Feaster says  What? Am I supposed to live in your tummy for the rest of my life?
Finn says  Everybody has a flaw... and it looks like yours is smelling like my nasty guts.
Fear Feaster heads back into Finn's stomach
Fear Feaster says  Sarcastically Wonderful...
"Pat McHale says  And so fear is forced deep within the soul of a hero. Conquered... at least, for now... Maniacal laugh"
The episode ends
Music is heard in the Tree Fort where Jake is playing his viola and Finn is listening with a glazed expression and his mouth wide open.
"Jake says  Looks up and stops playing Are you okay, dude?"
"Finn says  Yeah, why?"
Jake says  You look bored.
"Finn says  Naw, that's just how I look when I'm listening to music."
"Jake says  Well good, because I'm about to kick it up a notch."
Finn says  Bring it!
"Jake starts playing again, and Finn's expression slowly turns to the same expression. They then hear a knock at the door."
"Finn says  walks to the door, and hops on Jake Who do you think it is?"
Jake says  Could be anybody. stretches so that Finn can look out the window
Finn says  Hmm... I can't quite make it out. Ice King turns his head
Ice King says  Eee!
Finn says  Ahh! It's the Ice King!
Jake says  The Ice King?!
"Ice King says  Think this is the right address, takes note out of his beard mmm is this, is this...."
Finn says  bursting out door with a sword and kicks the Ice King down Eiiiiaah!
"Jake says  Yeah! Kick his butt, dude!"
"Finn attacks Ice King with his sword, but the Ice King uses his ice powers to hover in the air and fire ice at Finn."
"Finn says  Eat my sword, Ice King! throws his sword in the air and then throws it at the Ice King who uses his ice as a shield"
Finn says  Aww.
"Ice King says  You can not defeat me, child!"
"Finn says  I will, though! With a sweet kick! throws himself in the air with his foot forward, but punches Ice king in the face at the last second Psych! The Ice King snuffs him with his beard and freezes his head then flings him on the ground."
"Jake says  Whoo, hoo hoo!"
"Ice King says  his hand in a threatening position above Finn Now I can kill you! Oh wait, wait, wait. I am so stupid! Silly Billy! I came by to tell you the good news!"
Finn says  What's the good news?
Ice King says  I'm getting married... to someone who wants to marry me! 
Finn and Jake both gasp
"Ice King says  My betrothed is right over there! waves to show them the Old Lady Princess, who is in a cart with some penguins Hi, honey!"
"Old Lady Princess says  Hey, cool guy."
Ice King says  I'm a lucky guy—I didn't even have to kidnap this one! She fell in love with me the moment I slipped on her engagement ring! wiggles his fingers in front of Finn and Jake
Finn says  Eww.
Old Lady Princess says  the penguins wheel her away Bye-bye!
"Ice King says  The lady penguins are throwing her one of those ""bachelorette"" parties."
"Jake says  To Finn This is weird, dude."
"Finn says  Hmm... if you get married, what about capturing princesses?"
"Ice King says  Oh well, no more capturing pretty princesses for this Ice King! laughs"
"Finn says  Ohhh... walking away well, fare thee well, Ice King!"
Ice King says  Hmm?
"Jake says  Yeah, good luck with ye and thy creepy wedding."
"Finn says  We totally support your decision to stop capturing princesses! closes door to Tree Fort, turns to Jake I'm happy for him. He hears knock at the door, he opens it to see Ice King is still there."
"Ice King says  laughs nervously Sure wish someone would throw me a bachelorette party—oop, I mean, ""man-lorette"" party."
Finn says  But we hate you.
"Ice King says  If you won't throw me man-lorette party, then I'll never have my last hurrah before buckling down with that battle axe! It'll drive me back to a life of stealing hot princesses! Is that what you want?!"
"Jake says  No. No, no, no, no, no."
"Finn says  to Jake Dude, we gotta show him a good time and treat him right. Otherwise, he'll go back to imprisoning ladies! I-I can't have that! I—"
"Jake says  puts his finger over Finn's mouth Shhh, I know. I know that you can't have that. Don't worry. turns to Ice King Alright, let's go party, Ice King."
Ice King says  giggles
"A montage begins with Finn, Jake, and Ice King at a dance party with some Party Bears. A girl bear winks at him and he winks back, prompting Boy Bear to get angry. Ice King uses his magic to freeze him, after which Finn slaps the Ice King as punishment."
They are then shown at a bar with Tree People all around them. Ice King sips his drink but spits it out in disgust at the Tree Person next to him. The guy punches Ice King and Ice King uses his magic to blow him away. Finn slaps the Ice King again.
"Finn and Jake are then seen floating down a river on a giant leaf with Ice King on a different leaf. Ice King does a cannonball next to them, splashing them with water and ending the montage."
Ice King says  now in the Grass Lands Best man-lorette party ever! laughs and conjures a snowball
Snowball says  laughs
Ice King says  laughs
Snowball says  laughs
"Ice King says  Fah! throws snowball at the ground, killing it Hahahaha! Now I'm gonna go get married! Hehehehe! ♫I'm gonna get married!♪"
"Finn says  walking toward Tree Fort Bye, Ice King! Good luck!"
Jake says  Have fun being married!
Finn says  No more stealing princesses!
Ice King says  Yeah--wait. No more s-stealing princesses? Wow.
Finn &amp; Jake says  running back to him What?!
Ice King says  I didn't realize I'd have to give up stealing the ladies.
Jake says  But you said you were fine with it!
"Ice King says  I know what I said, but, y'know, sometimes you say things and then you don't really mean them."
Jake says  What? Are you serious?!
Ice King says  I'm just not sure I wanna get married in such a hurry. What if she's just after my pulls back his beard Demonic Wishing Eye and Ghost pouch? laughs maniacally
Finn says  We just took you out partying so that you could feel better about getting hitched!
"Ice King says  Maybe I'll just go back to capturing lots of girls. It's what I feel comfortable doing, y'know? Being free, wind at my back, lots of girls, kidnapping 'em."
"Finn says  starting towards Ice King Alright, here comes my double kick!"
"Jake says  holding him back Finn, Finn, cool yourself, buddy. We need to get this guy married, remember?"
"Finn says  Yeah, I remember."
"Jake says  Watch. walking to Ice King Let big brother handle this. poking Ice King Hey, Ice King? Don't be nervous. Marriage is the most beautiful thing that could ever happen to a jerk like you."
Ice King says  Really? Why?
"Jake says  starts sweating ""Why?"" walks back to Finn Poots, that guy is good. Why? Why?"
Finn says  Jake—
"Jake says  Not now! to himself Why, why, why, why, why?"
Ice King says  My mind is made up—80% sure. No marriage.
"Finn says  Well, uh... don't you wanna grow old with somebody? Right? pointing Just like these old swans."
Two old swans are shown kissing in a nearby pond.
"Ice King says  Bleh, those stinky old swans. Huh?"
The male swan swallows the female one. He opens his mouth and the other one pokes out its head and laughs.
Finn &amp; Jake says  What?!
"Ice King says  Ohhhh, now I get what you guys are trying to tell me! Marriage is a thing that allows me to capture a princess forever and let her live inside of me! crying Marriage is the most beautiful thing in the world!"
"Finn says  Uhh... Yeah—I-I never—uhh... I guess it is. to Jake Jake, this is bad news, man! We gotta go tell him that he can't eat his wife!"
"Jake says  Eh, let's cross that bridge when we get to it. Look how happy he is."
Ice King says  The wedding? Back on—100%! laughs and skips away
Finn says  wipes sweat from brow Phew!
Jake says  All that's left is the lousy wedding. fist bumps Finn
Finn says  I'm weddy for the wedding!
Finn and Jake walk to the Ice King's Castle wearing black bow ties.
"Finn says  Y'know, even though the Ice King is a wad, I'm pretty happy for him."
"Jake says  Uh-huh. This wedding looks lame, man. Ice King is seen on a snow pyramid with some penguins and Snowman Priest Be prepared to be bored outta your mind."
Finn says  laughs
"Ice King says  Finn, Jake, you made it! Ice King is shown tying up Old Lady Princess, who is wearing a veil Come on up here. I'm almost finished tying up my bride."
Finn says  Weird—and your bride is into that?
"Ice King says  This is a traditional wedding ritual for good luck in the Ice Kingdom. You see, she'll be hoisted up and then lowered down—and when she touches my beard from above, she will be my queen! giggles"
"Finn says  Well... shrugs cool, man. I'm glad y'all are happy... being crazy together."
"Ice King says  Thank you! Excuse me as we finish preparing for the nuptials. 2, 4, 8, 16, 20, uh—"
Snowman Priest says  32.
"Ice King says  Yes—32, 64, one hundred and—eh."
Flower Girl Penguin lifts Old Lady Princess's veil and she opens her eyes.
"Finn says  Huh? Her eyes are huge! I'm gonna go check 'em out. sees Jake scratching his ear And stop scratching your ear, man—it's gross."
"Jake says  It wasn't me—it was my foot, dude."
"Finn says  walks up to princess Whoa, you've got ridiculously large eyes, princess! Are you allergic to somethin'?"
"Old Lady Princess says  tearing up No, Finn. I was just born like this."
Finn says  Why are you crying?
"Old Lady Princess says  I'm not crying, Finn—my tear sac is broken!"
Camera zooms in on her eyes and an old lady behind bars can be seen in them.
Old Lady in eye says  Help me!
Finn says  What?!
Old Lady Princess says  I didn't say anything.
Old Lady in eye says  The Ice King cursed me! You've gotta set me free. I would rather die than marry the Ice King!
Finn &amp; Jake says  gasp
Finn says  He tricked me! And I was happy for that son of a toot!
Jake says  points Look at her ring.
Old Lady Princess is shown wearing a spiky ring made of ice.
Ice King flashback says  She fell in love with me the moment I slipped on her engagement ring.
"Finn says  That's what cursed her! Don't worry, princess. I'll remove this ring and save your life. tries to pull off ring"
Ice King says  No! She's my love boat! zaps at them with ice magic but misses
"Finn says  No, man. You cursed her. She hates you!"
"Ice King says  Okay, that's your opinion! gets ready to zap again"
"Jake says  Wait a minute! sighs So you knew she was cursed all along, which means you knew she wasn't trying to steal your Demonic Eye Junk or whatever, and you knew you had total control of her!"
"Ice King says  Yeah, yes, that's right."
Jake says  So then why did you make us go through all that junk about why marriage is worth stuff?!
"Ice King says  Oh, I don't know... I'm complicated—and spontaneous! laughs That's probably why she wants to marry me!"
Jake says  She wants to marry you because you brainwashed her!
Ice King says  Silence! shoots ice at them
"Finn &amp; Jake says  Whoa, wait! the ice freezes their feet Aw, man!"
Ice King says  It's time for the lowering ceremony! Hoist her up!
"Some penguins pull on the rope, lifting Old Lady Princess up into the air. Finn tries to break the ice holding his feet down."
Ice King says  Hehehehe! Commence the lowering!
The Old Lady Princess starts being lowered slowly. Finn takes off his bow tie and uses it to break the ice.
"Ice King says  Yes, nothing can stop me now."
"Finn says  Hyah! punches Ice King, and they both fall off the pyramid What is wrong with you, man?! grabs Ice King's nose"
Ice King says  Strangling the groom's nose at a wedding? kicks Finn back up the pyramid What's wrong with you?! You're the one that there's something wrong with!
"Finn lands at the top of the pyramid by the penguins that were holding the rope. They let go of the rope, dropping the Old Lady Princess. Jake catches her."
Jake says  Gotcha!
"Old Lady in eye says  Thanks, man"
"Jake says  Hehe, no problem."
Finn says  getting up Ehh.
Ice King says  walking up to him I think you dropped something. tosses a penguin at him Catch! freezes the penguin in midair
Finn says  Huh? catches the penguin and sinks into the snow a couple feet
Ice King fires a bolt of ice at Jake.
Jake says  Whoa! bolt freezes him
Finn says  Jake!
Jake starts falling from the weight of the ice but takes the ring off of Old Lady Princess as he falls.
"Old Lady Princess says  eyes now normal-sized Huh, what?"
"Finn says  JAKE! tries to lift the penguin Grrrr. Jake slides down next to him Oh, hey."
Jake says  Hey.
Finn says  You got the ring off her finger?
"Jake says  Huh? Oh. Oh yeah. Now she's not hypnotized, but we're still frozen."
Finn says  I got a plan.
"Jake says  Oh, good."
"Ice King says  Now, let's try that again. to penguins Lower her!"
"Old Lady Princess says  struggling with rope as she gets lowered You lousy, butt-faced pig! I hate you!"
"Ice King says  Here she comes. Yes, touch my beard, deary. Yes, that's right. Almost there..."
Finn says  Now!
Jake says  strains
Jake's finger touches Ice King's beard.
"Ice King says  Oh! I'm married, right, snowman?"
"Snowman Priest says  Yes, it's official."
"Finn says  It's official! You done married a dog, dude!"
Ice King says  What? What's that supposed to— sees that the finger that touched his beard is actually Jake's Oh no.
Finn &amp; Jake says  laugh
"Jake says  Wait, what the—? What am I laughin' about?"
Scene cuts to Tree Fort
Finn says  sighs And now everything's back to normal.
"Jake says  Well, I wouldn't say everything."
"Ice King says  pounding on the door Come on, guys. Help me celebrate my un-marriage."
Finn &amp; Jake says  laugh
Episode ends
Episode starts in the Candy Kingdom. Finn and Jake are laughing while throwing bottles at a nearby wall.
"Jake says  Here, try throwing this one."
"Jake hands Finn a bottle. Finn throws the bottle. When it breaks, a purple vapor in a humanoid form appears and vanishes."
Jake says  Jake picks up an orange bottle. Here's one called Caturday Surprise.
Finn says  Throw it!
"Jake throws the bottle. Green, pink, and blue cats explode out of it. Both Finn and Jake start laughing. They stop their laughter once they hear Princess Bubblegum."
"Princess Bubblegum says  Yeah, go on, get out of here! An unknown figure runs away from Princess Bubblegum who is standing at the entrance of the Candy Kingdom. Unless you feel like a fist cookie, you better keep runnin'!"
Finn says  What the heck is goin' on?
Jake says  I have no idea. But it's probably best to stay out of it.
"Finn says  Yeah. Hey, look. Finn grabs a bottle shaped like a boomerang. This one looks stupid. Let's see how it flies! Finn throws the bottle. It misses the wall and flies away. Aw, lame. The bottle then turns around and flies back at them. It flies up and into a window of the Candy Castle."
Jake says  Uh-oh...
Camera shows window that was shattered.
Princess Bubblegum says  yells Duke of Nuts! Princess Bubblegum looks out of the window. Her head is green and she is now bald. What have you done?!
Duke of Nuts says  Oh... runs away
Finn says  Oh no! She thinks that nuts guy did it. We gotta go clear up what happened!
Scene changes to inside the room with the shattered window. Dr. Ice Cream is putting a thick rubber suit on Princess Bubblegum.
"Dr. Ice Cream says  Don't worry, my dear. I'll have you fixed up in no time!"
Finn says  Princess! Finn and Jake run into the room. Are you OK?
"Princess Bubblegum says  Yeah, I guess if green and bald is okay."
Finn gasps as Jake starts to laugh. Finn looks at Jake annoyingly.
Jake says  while laughing Oh boy. I'm sorry! I can't stop now.
Princess Bubblegum looks depressed from Jake's reaction.
"Dr. Ice Cream says  My dear, not to worry! The medicine milk in this suit will have you healed lickety-split! In just five days you'll be back to your beautiful bubblegummy self."
Princess Bubblegum says  yells Five days?! The Grand Meeting of Ooo Royalty is tonight! Princess Bubblegum pops a hole in her suit. Dr. Ice Cream tries to cover it.
"Finn says  Uh... hey, Princess. There's something I should tell you about that bottle that hit you in the face."
"Princess Bubblegum says  I already know, Finn! The Duke of Nuts has always been a bad guy. But now that he's done this, I'll never forgive him! And it's not just because I hate the Duke! I'd never forgive anybody who did this to me! I'd hate them!"
Finn says  Yeah but-
Princess Bubblegum says  FOREVER!
Finn says Forever?!
Princess Bubblegum says  Finally. I have a witness to his misdeeds!
Jake says  Two witnesses!
Finn says  Jake!
"Princess Bubblegum says  Oh Finn, my flawless, flawless champion, bring the Duke of Nuts to justice. The justice of a cold dungeon! Princess Bubblegum laughs hysterically as holes pop in her suit. Dr. Ice Cream rushes over to try and stop the leaks. Finn and Jake laugh nervously."
Jake says  Heheh. She's completely bonkers.
"Finn says  What do I do? If I tell her I threw it, she'll hate me forever!"
Jake says  Don't worry! elbows Finn lightly That won't happen. We're gonna catch that Duke!
Finn says  But we're the ones who threw the bottle!
"Jake says  Dude, look. The Duke of Nuts is bad guys."
Finn says  How do you know that?
"Jake says  Think about it. If Bubblegum hates him so much, then he must have done some rotten stuff. I mean, maybe he even threw a bottle and turned someone ugly before."
Finn says  Maybe you're right.
Jake says  Maybe I am!
"Finn says  Alright, just this once, we'll be vigilantes!"
"Jake says  Nah, we're more like cops. Crooked cops! Jake makes a gun with his fingers and pretends to shoot something."
Finn says  Princess! I won't rest until the villainous duke is captured!
"Princess Bubblegum says  with a creepy smile Oh, thank you, Finn! laughs maniacally."
"Finn says  Woah. Okay, and by then, hopefully you'll have taken care of...this. moves hand over face"
Scene changes to the Duke of Nuts' castle. Finn and Jake walk towards it.
Finn says  Look yonder! The Duke of Nuts castle!
"They kick open the door, barging in."
Finn says  Duke of Nuts!
Jake says  How are you?
Finn says  By order of Princess...
The Duchess of Nuts turns around in a chair by the fireplace in the room where Finn and Jake barged in.
"Finn says  hesitantly Um, Princess... The Duchess of Nuts turns her head around 180 degrees to face Finn. Finn gasps"
"Duchess of Nuts says  Hello, Finn. Are you here to arrest the Duke?"
Finn says  How did you know?
Duchess of Nuts says  grabbing a bowl of nuts The nuts told me...for I am the Duchess of Nuts!
"Jake says  Jake starts eating the nuts from the bowl. He then stops in realization. Oh... should've asked if these were, like, her eggs or something."
Duchess of Nuts says  I know of my husband's crime against the princess. A crime that you personally witnessed! And why would you lie? Huh?
"Finn says  Yeah, why?"
"Duchess of Nuts says Oh but he was once such a wonderful man! He'd pet dogs, kissed babies; we'd lie together underneath the cashew bush. He even taught under-privileged nuts how to dance. But somehow he's gone rancid! These nuts tell me he must be executed. Would you like to hear what my nuts have to say?!"
Finn says  That won't be...um...necessary.
The Duchess starts running after them.
Duchess of Nuts says  Listen! Listen!
"Finn runs out, grabbing Jake."
Jake says  Woah!
Scene changes to outside the Duke of Nuts' Castle. Finn closes the door behind him.
"Finn says  I don't get it, Jake. How can the dude be evil if he pets puppies, kisses babies, and lies with his wife?"
"Jake says  What?! You believe that? She is nuts. Listen, man. Let's just go back and face the music. Who cares if Bubblegum hates you forever? It's no biggie. Tons of people hate me!"
Scene changes to somewhere in a forest. A squirrel is reading some kind of newspaper in a hologram.
"Squirrel says  Why, Jake? Why won't you print my letters? I...I...I HATE YOU!"
Scene switches back to Finn and Jake.
Finn says  Hmm. gasps A figure runs past Finn and Jake. It's him! The Duke of Nuts!
Finn and Jake run after him.
Finn says  while running I'll break left! You take the right! They both go in their direction. Finn tackles him while Jake jumps over them.
Jake says  I went left too!
They both fall on the figure from before.
Finn says  Wha-? Finn picks him up. You're way smaller than I thought you were!
Jake says  Dude. That's not him.
Marquis of Nuts says  No one will harm the Duke of Nuts! I will kill whoever seeks to arrest him!
The Duke of Nuts walks out of the forest.
Duke of Nuts says  No! Please! This has gone far enough!
Jake says  That's the Duke of Nuts.
"Marquis of Nuts says  But I vowed to kill whoever did this to you. They can't take you away, Dad! cries"
Duke of Nuts says  Who's the toughest little nut? That's you. Marquis of Nuts continues to cry into the Duke of Nuts' shoulder. He puts one finger up to Finn and Jake. One second.
Finn uses his hands to ask if they should walk away. The Duke of Nuts thumbs them up. Finn and Jake walk away.
"Finn says  Man, I don't know, Jake. Why would Princess Bubblegum hate him if he's such a nice guy?"
"Jake says  Just because he's a good father, doesn't necessarily mean he isn't a villain."
Finn says  That doesn't look like a villain.
Camera shows the Duke of Nuts putting his cape down for geese to walk across so they don't get wet.
Jake says  I can probably think of a reason why that's villainous if you gave me enough time. Maybe.
"Finn says  Ugh! Maybe we should just confess. But then, Princess Bubblegum will hate us forever."
"Jake says  Hey man, it's not that bad being hated."
A letter flies near Jake's foot.
"Squirrel says  C'mon man, pick it up!"
"Finn and Jake walk by it, unnoticed."
Squirrel says  You son of a bleeblop!
"Duke of Nuts says  Oh! Sorry to make you wait. I made these daisy crowns for you guys as a- as a token of gratitude for waiting. Finn and Jake put the crowns on. Oh...sorry I....I have to sit down for a second. I know this is an odd question, but you wouldn't happen to have any pudding on you, would you?"
"Finn says  Actually yeah, I think I have one in my pack."
"Duke of Nuts says  Oh, thank goodness."
Finn says  I think I have a spoon in here too- wha-?
We see the Duke of Nuts has already eaten all of the pudding.
Jake says  What happened to the cup?
The Duke takes it out of his mouth and puts it in Jake's hand.
"Duke of Nuts says  Oh, I'm so embarrassed! Now you know my shame. I can't stop eating pudding."
Finn says  What?!
"Duke of Nuts says  I don't tell people because I hate making them worry, but yes, I have a rare condition. A pudding deficiency. And I always end up eating all of the royal pudding supply whenever I go to the castle."
Finn says  So that's why Princess Bubblegum hates you!
"Duke of Nuts says  Yes, but I didn't turn Princess Bubblegum green and bald! I would never do such a thing!"
"Finn says  Gah! Of course you wouldn't! You're too nice a guy. I'm the one who threw that bottle. I was gonna tell her, but then-- she started talking all crazy-- she said she'd never forgive me and I-- I didn't know!"
"Duke of Nuts says  Hey, it's okay. People make mistakes. It's all part of growing up and you never truly stop growing."
Finn says  Now you're making me feel even worse by being so nice about it.
Duke of Nuts says  Maybe I should just confess the crime and end all of this.
Finn says  Wait...I think I might have an idea that will save everyone's reputations.
Scene changes to later that day. Peppermint Butler is driving Princess Bubblegum around in a mobile bath tub filled with healing milk. Finn jumps out of the forest and stops them.
Finn says  Halt!
Princess Bubblegum says  Finn! Did you find the duke yet?
"Finn says  Not yet, but you are in grave danger, Princess. There is an assassin in these very woods, dead set on stopping you from reaching the Grand Meeting. In fact, what's that rustling in the bush??"
"Jake says  behind bush while shaking the bush Rustle. Rustle, rustle. Jake jumps out suddenly. I'm an ambush! Halt!"
Finn says  What's going on?!
"Jake says  Oh, out of character Did I come out to early?"
"Finn says  coughs What are you here to do, stranger?"
Jake says  I've come for the princess. I'm an assassin!
"Princess Bubblegum says  Um, guys?"
Finn says  Stand back! I will stop him! Hi-yah!
Jake says  Hi-yah!
Both Finn and Jake jump into the air. They pretend fight for a couple of seconds.
Jake says  I will kill you! And raise your children as my own!
Finn says  Hi-yaah!
They still pretend to fight until Jake actually punches Finn into a nearby rock.
Jake says  Hah!
"Finn says  Remember, it's just acting, Jake!"
"Jake says  while running towards Princess Bubblegum Sorry, dude! Jake kicks Peppermint Butler to the side and stretches right in front of Princess Bubblegum. Now, to kill you up. But wait, surely this cannot be the fair Princess Bubblegum! Where are her pink, flush cheeks? The long gooey hair? Princess Bubblegum punches Jake to the ground. Clearly, the princess travels elsewhere. Out of character Later, Bubblegum! Jake jumps into the bush he was hiding in before. Get out there, man!"
Duke of Nuts says  behind bush I don't know if I can do this.
"Jake says  Go, go, go, go!"
"Duke of Nuts says  And that's how I, the Duke of Nuts, by disfiguring you beyond all recognition, humbly saved your life."
"Jake says  jumping out of bush Yeah, alright!"
Finn says  while still on ground from the impact of rock Yeah!
Princess Bubblegum says  What was the point of this little play again? gasps And why isn't the duke clapped in irons?!
"Duke of Nuts says  She's right. Innocent or not, I should accept what's coming to me."
Princess Bubblegum says  Peppermint Butler! Peppermint Butler comes out of the shadows with golden handcuffs. He starts to walk towards the Duke of Nuts.
"Finn says  Oh, no!"
Duke of Nuts says  Nuttin's going my way today.
"Peppermint Butler jumps up to handcuff the Duke of Nuts. However, he can't reach. Finn runs between them and keeps them apart."
Finn says  No!
Princess Bubblegum says  Finn?
"Finn says  The duke didn't throw that bottle! Ahh- Princess, I have something sucky to confess. I'm the one who threw the bottle. Princess Bubblegum gasps. I'm sorry, but I knew if I told you, you'd hate me forever!"
"Princess Bubblegum says  Hmm...well, I could never stay mad at you forever. And you seem genuinely penitent."
"Finn says  I don't even know what that means, but thank you!"
The Duke of Nuts is laughing with Jake.
Princess Bubblegum says  points at them But that doesn't douse my hatred for the duke!
"Finn says  Yeah, what's up with that hate?"
Princess Bubblegum says  That jerk always empties out my pudding pantry!
"Finn says  Aw, shucks. He just can't control himself around pudding. He goes cocoa-nuts for it! Because he has a pudding deficiency!"
"Duke of Nuts says  It's true, your majesty. I'm sorry for my medical condition."
"Princess Bubblegum says  Oh, my, you poor man! Of course you're forgiven! whispering to Finn Yeah, I don't believe a word from him."
"Finn says  sighs I'm really sorry about making you temporarily ugly, Princess. Especially before the Grand Meeting of Ooo Royalty. I wish there was some way to make it up to you."
"Princess Bubblegum says  Maybe there is, Finn. Maybe there is... hey! Princess catches Finn and Jake walking away."
"Finn says  turning around Hmm, what? You said maybe."
Scene changes to the Grand Meeting of Ooo Royalty.
Turtle King says  while hitting gavel on podium Call to order the sesquicentennial Grand Meeting of Ooo Royalty. I now call upon the delegate from the Candy Kingdom. Princess Bubblegums?
"Camera pans to show Finn and Jake, who are dressed up like Princess Bubblegum. Finn gets up and reads off a pre-written letter from the princess."
Finn says  Ahem! It would be presumptuous indeed to present myself against the distinguished princess to whom you have listened.
Jake says  yawning and talking to an oval-shaped member of royalty Buy a lady a drink?
A mask falls off the oval-shaped member of royalty to show that it is actually the Marquis of Nuts.
Finn and Jake says  gasps The Marquis of Nuts?!
"Marquis of Nuts says  Yes, but I didn't come alone!"
The face of the Turtle King is ripped open and the Squirrel comes out.
"Squirrel says  Remember me, Jake?!"
Jake says  ...nope.
Both the Marquis of Nuts and the Squirrel start screaming and jump on top of Finn and Jake. The episode pauses before they land on them.
Episode begins in Yellow Forest. There are graves littered on the grass.
Birds are chirping; Finn and Jake walking
"Finn says  Walking, walking, walking – hambone break! Finn starts ham-boning"
Jake says  WooHoo! Hey!
Finn starts playfully slapping Jake
Jake says  Get away from me. Quit it. Laughs and blushes
Off screen says  Food for a beggar…
A mysterious man is lying on the grass in tattered clothing
Man says  Food for a poor old man? Gets up off grass with a flip
Finn and Jake are surprised.
Jake says  Whoa!
"Finn says  Geez Louise, guy"
"Man says  So you got any, kid? Food? Hand out in front of Finn"
"Finn searches through backpack, finds a cube of sugar"
"Finn says  I got this little piece of sugar. Thinks Nuts, I'm freaking all about sugar. But I am even more about feeding hobos! Clenches cube in fist"
"Jake says  Whoa, man. Maybe helping this starving homeless guy is wrong thing to do."
Finn says  Why?
"Jake says  I don't know. I said ""Maybe"" Shrugs"
"Finn says  A hero always helps someone in need and besides he's probably a secret elf who will reward us for being nice. Here you go, buddy. Hands sugar to man"
"Man says  snatches the sugar from Finn's hand and eats it You know, believe or not, I'm not really a beggar. I'm actually a… Reveals Himself Magic Man!"
Magic Man little riff
Finn and Jake says  Stunned Whoa!
"Finn says  Aw, yeah!"
Jake says  He's magic! I didn't expect this.
"Magic Man says  Magic Man is down on one knee and starts whistling, a bird lands in his hand. While the bird is in his hand, he rubs the fingers of his other hand together and the bird is turned inside out. Its Muscles and fat are on the outside. Magic.... Away! Shoos the bird away, it drops to the ground flapping its wings struggling to fly away. Finn and Jake are distraught. Finn is holding Jake."
"Jake says  with eyes closed and shuddering Think happy thoughts… Little, cute, bees, little babies, tiny, tiny bunnies."
"Finn says  what is wrong with you, Magic Man?!"
"Magic Man says  You gave me that candy now I'll do you a favor in return. A magic favor. Zaps Finn, blue dust cloud covers Finn Sings A mystical, magical favor! Finn's body starts transforming"
"Jake says  looks on worried. Finn is shaped like a giant foot, well just his lower half. His top half remains the same Whoa, dude!"
Magic Man says  ...For you!
Finn says  why did you do that!?
"Magic Man says  Because on this day, a magical life lesson comes to you."
Finn says  No! Change me back.
"Magic Man says  Not until you appreciate what a jerk I am. Wazoo! Magic Man jumps in the air and explodes into fireworks. Fireworks say ""Eat It."""
Jake says  What a nutty guy
"Finn says  What the heck, man?? What kind of deal is that? I help somebody out and they make me a stinky foot."
Jake says  sniffs Finn. You smell pretty good.
"Finn says  Shoves Jake away from him Get off of me, man! I can't be a hero if I'm a big good-smelling foot!"
"Jake says  Maybe you're looking at this magic gift all wrong. Now that you're a huge foot you can kick evil's butt, like, way more times as hard. You're 100% kick, man!"
Finn says  Why are you being so level-headed about this?
"Jake says  Don't be a siss, Finn. Here, c'mon kick my butt. Jake stretches his butt big and wide. Finn blushes"
"Finn says  You're the SISS, siss! Augh! tries to kick Jake but instead falls over, hitting Jake slightly."
"Jake says  rubbing his butt Ouch! oooh! Ouch. See, man. Let's give your foot body a shot."
"Finn says  still on the ground No, dude! I wanna go find that magic man and get my body back!"
Jake says  Jake cradles Finn's head Shhh shhh shhh shhh. Just be a foot for a little bit J manipulates F's mouth like puppet
"Jake as Finn says  Ok, I will."
Jake says  Awesome! Dude you will never regret this. Hahaha!
Next scene says still in the forest. Finn is upside-down and attached to some sort of spring catapult with a trigger.
"Jake says  Okay, when the next monster comes along, he'll step on that trigger over there, sending your giant foot body into the monster's crotch!"
"Finn says  This sucks, dude."
Jake says  Caressing Finn Shhh!
"Monster says  Off- screen roaring. A two-headed monster comes into view. We're evil! steps on trigger and Finn is launched into its crotch, monster roars Our crotch! our evil crotch!!"
Jake says  runs away while holding Finn's foot body in the air Hahaha! What'd I tell you? You're a great hero! Let's go set up some more crotch catapults so we can laugh and be heroes.
"Finn says  No, Jake. Let's find that Magic Man."
"Jake says  Finn, being an enormous crotch-kicking foot is a gift. Don't scorn a gift."
Indistinct shouting is heard; they see Rump Town on fire
Jake says  Town on fire! This looks like a job for foot Finn stomping ability!
"Finn says  But I-I can't even bend these big fat toes, man."
"Jake says  You can do it, Finn. What'd I teach you, dude?"
Finn says  unsure Not to scorn the kicking of people in the crotch?
"Jake says  You got it! Now I'm gonna go rescue all the babies in town deep voice, face close-up --only the babies. Normally Get your hero on, dude!"
Jake throws Finn towards Rump Town. Finn flies through the air
Finn says  Aaahh!
More shouting and running townspeople. Finn land in the middle of the town
"Finn says  Uhh. Okay, you can do this, Finn. Sweaty and determined Start small, man. I'm taking you down! Points at the fire"
Finn struggles to move his body and falls on top of a small fire
"Finn says  screaming It's hot! Oh, man, I'm smoking hot! Please, help me out! I can't move!"
"Townspeople gather around Finn, angrily"
Townsperson red shirt says  It's another one of those freaks!
Townsperson green shirt says  He probably started this fire!
"Finn says  No, I didn't start any –"
Townsperson blue shirt says  Throw him under the bridge with the others!
Townspeople pick up Finn and carry him off to the bridge
Townspeople all says  Get rid of the freak. Chanting Freak! Freak!
Finn is thrown off the bridge
"Finn says  Unh! Sighs and sniffs I'm not a freak, I'm a hero."
Jake calls out to Finn. Jake runs toward Finn with his arms full of babies.
Jake says  Finn!
"Finn says  Jake, how'd you find me?"
"Jake says  Oh, I can sense when you're about to cry. It's like a mother/daughter thing."
"Finn says  upset I'm not going to cry, man! I just feel like crying. We have to find that magic guy and Jake lets go of the babies and they crawl away. get my body back now!"
Jake says  What we have to do is find out what reeks under this bridge sniffs
Finn says  Jake!
Jake walks toward the underside of the bridge.
"Jake says  Ew, it's blocking out your good foot smell."
Finn says  Get back here!
"Jake says  Ugh, it—it smells like vomit on fire. It's like fancy cheese in an old guy's mouth."
Behind Jake there is a Cyclops creature with no legs or arms under the bridge. It hops towards Jake.
"Cyclops says  Welcome, travelers."
"Jake jumps in the air, surprised."
Jake says  Ahh!
Jake picks up Finn.
"Cyclops says  I am Gork, leader of Freak City. Ah, I can see one of you has felt the Magic Man's touch. Looks at Finn"
Finn says  Yeah! You know that guy?
Gork walks back underneath the bridge. Finn and Jake follow.
Gork says  I will tell you all that I know.
"Under the bridge, Gork vomits lava on the ground that turns into fire. The fire illuminates the makeshift caveFreak City. There are other creatures seen under the bridge."
"Gork says  We are the accursed ones, all once normal guys and gals who crossed paths with the Magic Man. Gork proceeds to introduce the other inhabitants of the cave. That's Zap, the Arm. the screen is focused in Zap, a pink humanoid arm. Zap mumbles. Trudy, the Waist. Trudy is shown as a blue lump. Trudy coughs. That's Wee Wee and Gorflax. They are shown as light brown ovals lying in a puddle. One is biting the other. They were turned into tonsils and that's Kim. Kim kisses a can and chuckles. She is beige colored leg. But, please, make yourselves at home. Would you like something to drink?"
Jake says  Do you have any orange juice?
"Gork says  No. Pause Well, uh, I don't know. Maybe. Uh, I don't think so. I'll go check."
Gork goes off in search of orange juice.
"Jake says  Yo, Finn, this place is really bumming me out. Let's get out of here."
"Finn says  What?! No, dude. These guys might be my only hope of finding the Magic Man."
Gork comes back with orange juice.
"Gork says  Hey, we actually do have orange juice."
Jake starts drinking the juice.
"Finn says  Thanks for being cool and all, but what do you know about this Magic Man? How do we catch him?"
"Gork says  Oh, he can't be caught. He's got magic and we're worthless freaks. We can't ever beat him. So we've gather here to wallow in our self-pity."
Finn says  But don't y'all even want to try?
"Kim says  Eh, no."
Finn says  Why not? You're all totally miserable here.
Zap says  Ugh. It's a living.
"Finn says  No, it's not, Zap! It's not a living! It's dookie diapers! I don't want to be a foot!"
"Trudy says  Well, get used to it. We did."
Gork falls to his side.
"Jake says  Yeah, Finn, maybe there's another lesson to be learned here--"
"Jake walks to a pile of garbage, sits down and gets comfortable."
"Jake says  To accept what fate has given you puts his arm around a rat and stay a miserable foot. Gork, can we stay here in this pile of trash and rats forever?"
"Gork says  Yeah, man. Do it up."
Jake says  flops down in trash Awesome. Rats flock to his body Here we go.
"Finn says  Jake, stop screwing around. slumps You're gonna make me give into depression."
"Jake says  rats crawl on his face Eh, what are you going to do about it? Probably nothing, right? If you're depressed, you'll do nothing. Rolls over"
Finn says  I… Depressed Maybe I will do nothing. Maybe I'll just lay down here. Grunts and struggles to get to the floor Lay down –uh falls to the ground—and rot like the rest of you.
Jake says  Excited Yeah! Chanting Stay a foot! Stay a foot! Stay a foot!
Finn closes his eyes and begins to daydream. Song begins.
Finn says  singing ♫ Is this really my life?
Is this how my story ends?
Finn is in space with his foot body.
"Bein' in this body,"
Seems like a battle that I cannot win.
Finn is trapped in a neon cube.
"Maybe I should lay my head down slow,"
"And sleep until it's all over,"
Finn lays his head on his hands. The cube disappears but leaves lines that bisect Finn.
"Is this the end,"
of the hero boy named Finn?
The pieces of Finn break apart and move through space. Finn opens his eyes and is back in the cave.
"Heck no! Darn it, no!"
This isn't how I go!
Finn picks himself up.
"I'm gonna kill it! I'm gonna kick life's butt,"
"And win it, to win it."
"I'm gonna take life's name,"
"And spit on it, and kick it!"
Spits and hops towards Gork.
"Life can just go eat it,"
Cause this is a man's game! ♫
ends singing
"Finn says  Get up, Gork!"
Gork says  Huh? Why?
resumes singing
"Finn says  ♪ I'm not gonna let you lie here,"
"And waste away,"
"You better get up, Gork, or I'll kick you up,"
Today's the day! ♪
"Gork says  Whoa. Okay man, just be cool."
Finn says  ♫ And I'm not gonna be cool!
Finn kicks Gork.
Cause I'm pipin' hot!
Finn kicks Trudy then kicks Kim.
"Get up, Trudy! Get up, Kim!"
I'm not gonna let you rot! ♫
Finn hops to Jake.
"Jake says  Hey, Finn."
"Finn says  ♫ Ja-a-a-ke, stop tellin' me to enjoy, bein' a foot, and get out of that trash! ♫"
"Jake says  Heh heh. I can't take you seriously when you're singing, man."
Finn says  Get up!
Kicks Jake into the air
Jake says  Ahh!
Finn says  ♫ All of you make me sick!
I'll fix you with my kicks!
"Gonna reconstruct y'all's self-worth,"
Kicks them all out of the cave and into the light
Brick by emotional brick. ♫
"Gork says  Wait, Finn!"
Finn kicks them into a pile. Gork is on top of Trudy and Kim and Zap are at his sides.
"Gork says  Hey, stop it, man! Gork, Kim, Zap, and Trudy stand up. We don't like touching each other."
Finn kicks them all except Jake and is puzzled.
Finn says  Huh?
"Gork, Trudy. Kim, Zap, Wee Wee and Gorflax are all clumped together."
"Gork says  Please, man."
"Finn says  Wait a second. Kim, get underneath Trudy."
"Kim says  No, man. Please. I freakin' hate Trudy."
"Finn says  angry Kim, I will destroy you!"
"Kim says  Okay, Okay! Moves to get under Trudy"
Jake walks up to Kim.
"Jake says  Yeah, do it, Kim."
Finn says  Yes! Now for me gets on the other side under Trudy Look at us!
"Gork, Trudy. Kim, Zap, Finn, Wee Wee and Gorflax are joined together to make a single body."
Jake says  Whoa!
They walk to a puddle and look at their reflection.
"Gork says  We're like a big, normal guy."
Kim says  Thank you so much
Zap says  We are perfect together
"Kim says  Oh, Finn, thank you."
Finn says  Word! Now let's go wreck up that Magic Man!
They jump up and down excitedly.
Jake says  Let me get in on this. I'll form the pants. Jake wraps his body around them
Off-screen
Magic Man says  Food. Food for a beggar
Finn gasps. Magic Man is in his hobo disguise
Magic Man says  Y'all got any food?
Gork says  We've got a little orange juice left over from – Wait a second…
"Magic Man says  That's right. It is I, the magic Man! Reveals himself and heaves magic their way. Zap"
They all shout.
"Magic Man says  Come on, apple grease! What are you gonna do?"
Zap punches Magic Man.
Magic Man says  Ohh!
Zap says  We're not afraid.
Magic Man says  Are you sure about that?
Finn says  You're darn right we are!
Gork vomits lava at Magic Man but it is deflected.
Finn says  Give us our bodies back!
Finn kicks Magic Man into a pile.
Magic Man says  Why should I? You still act like a hero only so you can get what you want.
Finn says  Oh. You were trying to teach us to be kind without expecting anything return. I should've given you that sugar cube without even thinking about a reward.
Magic Man says  Wrong! Hurls magic at them again. It hits Finn in the face.
"Finn says  Ah, geez!"
Jake says  worried Finn!
"Finn says  angry You've gifted us nothing but heartache, Magic Man! What is the life lesson in that?!"
"Magic Man says  laughs maniacally Yes, my children, you are so close to the answer."
Finn says  Answer this!
They jump on top of Magic Man. He is stuck underneath Finn's foot body.
Kim says  Get his eyes! Cut him in the eyes!
Finn says  I wish I'd never been nice to you 'cause you're just a big jerk!
"Magic Man says  Oh, yes, that's it! Slips from under Finn's foot body You've finally learned your lesson. Zaps them with magic that returns them back to normal And now I'm off spread my teachings to more sissy do-gooders. Opens a portal to escape You're welcome!"
"Finn says  Man, I frickin' hate that guy. But at least now we can all go back to our regular lives."
"Gork, Kim, Trudy, Wee Wee and Gorflax are still voluntarily linked as a single body – even though they have their original bodies back."
"Gork says  Well, actually, we like being like this"
"Zap says  Yeah, we're strong together"
"All says  Bye, Finn! Thank you!"
They wave and walk off-screen.
"Finn says  Oh, okay. Bye, guys. See you, later. Waves back at them Wait, so, what was the lesson we just learned?"
"Jake says  shrugs Maybe it was, don't give your sugar to jerks."
"Finn says  Speaking of jerks, what the blubbins, man?! Why wouldn't you help me turn back into a boy?!"
"Jake says  Well, because I kind of always wanted mumbles"
Finn says  What?
"Jake says  embarrassed I said, I kind of always wanted to be a foot myself."
Finn says  You could be a foot right now. I saw you change into a foot twice yesterday.
Finn and Jake start walking away.
"Jake says  It's complicated, man. You'll understand when you're older."
Episode ends
The episode begins in an area filled with bones where Finn and Jake are playing.
Finn says  Hahahaha! Here I go!
Jake says  Yeah!
Finn says  Sliding down skeleton Whoo-hoo!!
"Finn hits the ground, and he, Jake, and many bones are propelled into the air. Marceline watches them discreetly."
Marceline says  Hmm...
Finn and Jake land.
"Finn says  Awesome! He and Jake laugh. Suddenly, crying is heard. Someone needs our help!"
Finn runs to the source of the crying. Jake spits out a bone and follows. They find Marceline talking to an old man.
"Marceline says  To her henchman What is it about ""henchman for life"" that you don't understand?"
"Old Man Henchman says  Oh, come on!"
Finn says  Whispering to Jake Dude! It's Marceline the Vampire Queen!
Jake screams and cowers in fear.
Old Man Henchman says  Can't you find the compassion to release this poor old body?
"Marceline says  ""Henchman for life"" means, ""henchman for life!!"""
Finn says  Whispering to Jake You still petrified of vampires?
Jake's head has sunk into his body.
Jake says  Prevaricating No... I'm not...
Marceline says  To old man Fall on the ground for me!
"Old Man Henchman says  Yes, Mistress. He does so."
Marceline says  Now cry for me!
"Old Man Henchman says  Okay. I don't want to cry, but I shall cry for you. He begins weeping."
Finn says  Running from behind bushes Hey! Cut that out!
Marceline says  Oh! If it isn't my favorite little goodie-two-shoes Finn!
Finn says  Stop making this poor old dude cry!
"Marceline says  I can make him do whatever I want. Watch. Henchman, amuse me."
The old man balances himself on his cane.
Finn says  Stop it!
Marceline says  Now hop around in a circle.
The old man hops around on his cane. The tip breaks and he falls down.
"Finn says  Oh, no. Don't worry, sir. I'll see to it you get set free."
"Marceline says  Oh, and how're ya gonna pull that off, hero?"
Finn says  I'll do what I need to. I'll even take his place!
"Jake says  Dude, what?!"
Marceline says  Do you mean it?
Finn says  Uh... well... He looks at the old man who is groaning tiredly. Heck yeah!
"Marceline says  Deal! Old henchman, you're free."
Old Man Henchman says  Whoo-hoo! Leaps off happily
"Jake says  What're you doing, man?"
"Marceline says  Hey, Jake.... BLEH!! She makes a horrific face."
Jake says  EEH! Grabs onto Finn
"Finn says  I couldn't watch that old man suffer, Jake. My code of honor wouldn't allow it."
"Marceline says  Laughs Mocking Finn ""Oh, my code of honor wouldn't allow it."" Cackles"
Jake says  Rrrr... HEY!
"Marceline says  Yes, Jake? Transforms into a werewolf creature What would you like to talk about?!"
"Jake says  AAAH! Runs to Finn's side I wanna help you outta this, man, but... she scares the filling out of my doughnut. Let's just leave."
"Finn says  I can't. As a hero, I'm bound by my Taken by Marceline into the air WOOOOORD!!"
"Jake says  FINN! Marceline cackles as they fly into the air. Don't worry, dude! I'll figure something out!!"
Scene transition; Marceline and Finn are flying through the air.
"Marceline says  You're lucky, Finn. Your first job as henchman is to help me feed."
"Finn says  Gasps; to himself Feed?! What does she mean? L-Like, like, oats? Like, sentient beings, or oats?! It doesn't matter! I can handle it!"
They arrive at a house that has music playing and a person singing.
"Marceline says  Sounds like dinner. Finn, open the door. Finn walks up to the door and strains himself. OPEN IT ALREADY!"
"Finn says  No way, Marceline! I'm not gonna open this door if innocent people will be hurt!"
"Marceline says  Crosses two white arms Aren't you bound by your word to do as I say, hero?"
Finn says  I... Sighs Yes... Turns and walks towards door
"Inside, the man is still playing. The door is opened and the draft blows the candles out."
Eberhardt says  Huh?
Finn says  Peach hand on the door Sorry about this.
Eberhardt says  Scared Haah!
"Marceline says  Hold him down! Finn groans. Marceline and Finn enter and close the door behind them. Jake appears and comes to the window. Are you enjoying this, Finn?"
Finn says  No!
Marceline laughs.
"Jake says  To himself yellow fist Rrr... Points by using yellow hand Don't you worry, Finn. I'll get you outta there. Open yellow hand I've got a perfect plan! Marceline laughs. She notices Jake through the window and hisses at him, turning into a lizard creature. AAH! Running from window I'm not running away, Finn! This is just part of my plan!!"
"Eberhardt says  Please, human boy! Let me go!"
"Finn says  White liquid stuff going down his face while he opens and closes his two eyes I'm sorry, sir. I'm bound by my code of honor to do what she says."
"Eberhardt says  I understand, son. I was married myself once. A single tear drops from his right eye."
"Finn says  Wait, wait! I'm not married to—"
Marceline says  Frustrated Ugh! Enough talking! Dinner is served!
Finn says  No! Pulls Eberhardt away before Marceline could bite him; Marceline attacks again. No! Pulls him away again
"Marceline says  Her two light blue eyes while her mouth has white triangular teeth How dare you, henchman?! I order you to let me feed!"
"Marceline blasts Finn's arms with a red beam, making them curl up and become immobile. She laughs, hisses and bites Eberhardt. Eberhardt screams."
Finn says  NOOOOO!!!
Marceline is revealed to have only been sucking Eberhardt's crimson bow tie.
Marceline says  Mmm. She winks one eye That red bow tie was delicious!
Finn says  Grunts Huh? Arms uncurl
"Marceline says  What's wrong, Finn?"
Finn says  I... I thought you were—
"Eberhardt says  Oh, my! A white tie! Thank you so much! This is so beautiful! Passes out"
Finn says  B-but...
Marceline says  What? You know I eat the color red sometimes. Winks
Finn says  Oh... Yeah... Okay...
Scene transition; they are flying through the air again.
Marceline says  We've got plenty more evil to do! Laughs
"Finn says  Thinking while his face has a frown Man... What's wrong with this girl? I can't tell if she's messin' with me, or... or what."
"Marceline says  Hey, Finn. You thinkin' about how that guy's bow tie sorta looked like a bra?"
Finn says  Huh? No!
The two arrive at a graveyard.
"Marceline says  I know this place seems a little dead, but don't worry. It'll soon be undead. Finn whimpers. Corpses buries in mud that's black, from death I command you to come back! The dead bodies rise out of the ground. ""Eeehhh... What's happening? Eh..."" Hahaha! Are you ready to lead an evil army of the undead?!"
"Finn says  Uhh, NEVER! A skeleton grabs Finn's rear end. Okay! I'll do it!"
Marceline laughs. Jake appears in the bushes.
"Jake says  To himself Don't worry, dude. I'm comin' to help you. YAAAAH!! Charges out of bushes with a stake towards Marceline"
Marceline says  Huh? What's that noise?
"Marceline turns around. As she does, Jake shrinks down and retreats."
"Jake says  To himself Sorry, Finn."
The scene shifts to the Duchy of Nuts where Finn and Marceline are walking towards the Duke of Nuts' castle with an undead army following behind them.
Marceline says  While swinging her two white arms Excited to hear the wild screams of an entire castle?
"Finn says  Faking Haha, aw, yeah, that sounds bombastic, honey! Hey, I'm gonna run up ahead and scout it out for you, sugar! Runs hurriedly"
Marceline says  Hahaha!
Finn knocks on the door. Lisby answers.
Lisby says  Yeeees? Duke and Duchess of Nuts' residence!
Finn says  My boss is gonna sack your castle!
"Lisby says  Oh! Well, that's certainly bad news for us!"
Duke of Nuts says  Lisby! Who's at the door?
Lisby says  Someone who wishes to sack the nut castle!
Duke of Nuts says  Why would you want to sack my nut castle on my second son's first birthday?! SEIZE HIM!
Finn says  No! The army draws closer. Listen! You hear that?! My master is marching here with her army of the undead!
Duke of Nuts says  Oh! How wonderful!
Finn says  Listen to me!! The army arrives. EVERYBODY!! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!
Marceline says  Hahaha! She flies into the palace. I wrote this next song about a fisherman. She sings the Fisherman Song.
"Finn says  Don't do this, Marceline! I beg you!"
Marceline says  She lands while holding her Ax bass Don't do what?
"Duke of Nuts says  You're late, Marceline! My son has been dying to hear your undead music!"
Finn says  Wha?!
"Lisby says  Oh, I forgot! Marceline is playing tonight!"
Marceline plays her bass while her two eyes closed. Everyone starts partying.
"Finn says  Okay... So, she makes things seem bad, a-and then... or-or her personality makes them seem bad, or... Sighs I'm over-reacting."
Lisby says  Hey!
Finn says  Huh?
Lisby says  Why are you thinking so hard?! Just party hard! Whoo!
Finn says  Alright! Whoo-hoo! Hahahaha!
"Marceline says  Hey, castle-crasher!"
"Finn says  Hey, Marceline!"
"Marceline says  You like cute things, right?"
"Finn says  Uh, yeah, sure. Why?"
Marceline says  Then you might love this. The cutest dimple plant ever! She holds a plant pot that has the dimple plant in it
Finn says  Whoa-ho-ho! That's cool!
"Marceline says  Here, eat some of its fruit. See what happens."
Finn says  He does so. Finn gains a dimple. Hahaha! A dimple!
"Marceline says  Okay, henchman, now... I need you to do something."
Finn says  What is it?
"Marceline says  I want you to take this dimple plant outside, and kill it!"
Finn says  What?!
Marceline says  Pulling it out Use my ax bass.
Scene shifts to outside where Finn is holding the guitar and standing in front of the plant.
"Finn says  I'm gonna murder you. I'm not entirely sure why. I'm sure this will end happy... Finn lifts up the ax and hesitates. He throws down the guitar. AAH! I don't get it! There's always a twist to the stuff Marceline makes me do, but where's the twist in bumping off this bush?!"
Marceline says  She enters then points by using one white hand while her white hand is on her hip There is no twist. Kill it now!
Finn says  But wh—
The plant turns into a monster.
Marceline says  Her two eyes closed while her two white hands on her hips You should've hacked it to pieces when it was still adorable...
"Finn says  I-I thought— The monster attacks Finn, but he evades the attack. He rolls, jumps towards the dimple plant monster and cuts one of its limbs. It sprays juice which Finn accidentally catches in his mouth. It makes him gain dozens of dimples. He spits the juice out. Sick!!"
The monster grabs Finn and eats him.
"Marceline says  Oh, boy... She simply detaches one of its limbs to kill the monster. Finn axes himself free. Not bad... for a henchman."
Finn says  Smiling Hmm...
The scene shifts to the next morning. Finn and Marceline are in a strawberry patch.
"Finn says  Hey. Can't the sun, like, destroy you? Marceline opens an umbrella then places it above her head while the handle of the umbrella looks like a skeleton bone"
"Marceline says  Yeah, it hurts, but I kinda like it. Reminds me of when I'd scrape my knees up as a kid, and my mom would patch me up... you know what I'm sayin'?"
Finn says  He points by using his peach hand Uh... Jake told me I came out of a cabbage. Then he places his two peach hands onto his chest
They both laugh.
"Marceline says  Hey, Finn, I need you to her two eyes change to two red eyes strangle some pixies."
"Finn says  Places his two peach hands into his white hat Yeah, sure. That sounds good."
"Marceline says  Whoa, why are you being so casual about that? Strangling pixies is some hardcore evil."
"Finn says  Backflips then points by using his two peach hands I'm not fallin' for your junk anymore, lady! You just like sayin' poop that places his two peach hands onto his face while closing his two eyes jacks with my brain!"
"Marceline says  Breaking What are you talking about? I... Laughs Dang, man, I didn't think you'd ever catch on!"
Finn says  Laughs I knew it! Hey... Marceline removes the red from the strawberry to change the strawberry to a gray colour by using her mouth what about your old henchman? Who was that guy?
"Marceline says  Oh, just an old diving buddy. She throws the gray strawberry Jake emerges from the bushes. Jokingly So, you ready to go strangle some pixies?"
"Finn says  Yeah, man! I mean, wo-man."
"Jake says  To himself Oh, no! My buddy is totally under her vampire spell! Yelling out Die, unholy thing! Throws garlic at her"
Finn says  Jake?
Marceline says  The garlic hits her. Ow! She drops her umbrella and hisses loudly as she stares at the sun. She moans as she falls on the ground and withers.
Finn says  Marceline!
"Jake says  I'm stakin' that vampire and settin' you free, no matter how terrified I am!"
"Finn says  She's alright, man!"
"Jake says  He holds the stake by using his yellow hand while his other yellow hand is a fist She's still controlling your mind with evil! Now, back off and let me vanquish her from existence!"
"Finn says  I can't let you do that, Jake!"
"Jake says  Sighs deeply I love you, brother. YAAAH! Attacks Finn, forcing him to the ground"
"Finn says  Jake, listen! Marceline is not how she seems! She's a radical dame who likes to play games!"
"Jake says  What are you even talkin' about, dude?!"
Marceline crawls under the umbrella.
"Finn says  Oh, man! Kicks Jake off his person"
"As Finn runs towards the umbrella, Jake smacks him away."
"Jake says  MARCELINE! Jake stakes the umbrella. As he lifts it, there's nothing but smoke and wailing is heard. Where is she?!"
Finn says  Faking I-I'm free! Jake! You faced your fear and saved me!
Jake says  I did?! I did! Yeah! singing I saved my bro from a scum-sucking vampire!! Runs away and laughs triumphantly.
Finn holds up the umbrella. Marceline as a bat comes out of Finn's pack.
Marceline as a bat says  Whispering Is it cool?
Finn says  Yup!
"Marceline as a bat says  Finn, I owe you big-time! Changing into a bat and hiding in your pack was genius!"
Finn says  That's what henchmen are for.
"Marceline as a bat says  Oh, uh, that reminds me. You're fired from your henchman-ship. It's no fun when I can't trick you. She crosses two arms"
"Finn says  We're still on for pixie-strangling tomorrow, though, right?"
Marceline says  Flying away with the umbrella Definitely.
The episode ends.
The episode begins at the Tree Fort. The camera pans to the bridge linking the living room and attic.
Finn says  Laughs Ahhh... YEAH!!! Busts through living room door and lands on bridge.
"Jake says  Entering Heh heh. Deep voice Aw, yeah. Chuckles"
"Finn says  Jake, get ready for a slap in the jowls. Slaps Jake's nose; Jake does a snorting laugh Seriously, though... get ready... for a day filled with adventure!"
"Jake says  Whoa, really?!"
"Finn says  Yeah, man!! He slaps Jake's nose again, making him snort and laugh again I wrote on my arm this to-do list of cool junk. The clouds begin to get darker and bigger Number one says back flip off this bridge and do the splits. Number two says track down and slay a goblin horde. Number three...Glances up at thundering clouds storm clouds?"
"Jake says  Examining Hmmm... Knives fall from the clouds and Jake gasps. Finn... it's a knife storm!! Finn slaps Jake's nose yet again It's raining knives, man! Come on! Exits"
Finn says  I've never seen a knife storm before... It's beautiful.
Knives begin falling near Finn; Jake pulls Finn inside before knives can fall on him.
"Jake says  Looks like we're stayin' in today, kid."
"Finn says  Well, what're we gonna do?"
BMO says  Who wants to play video games??
Finn and Jake says  BMO!!
"Jake says  What's on the menu, BMO?"
BMO says  I've created a new game called Conversation Parade.
Finn says  Hah! Alright!
"Jake says  Start it up, BMO!"
BMO says  singing What do you think about the stars in the sky?
"Finn says  'S okay, I guess."
"Jake says  Yeah, they're cool."
BMO says  That is an interesting response! Battery low... Shut doooowwwwn...
Finn says  Booooo.
"Jake says  BMO, that was weak."
Finn says  What now?
"Jake says  Ooh, ooh! Dude, I know somethin' totally rockin' we can do!"
Finn says  Whoa! What?!
"Jake says  Let's use our imaginations, man!"
Finn says  Barf that! Imagination is for turbo nerds who can't handle how kick-butt reality is! I'm a kick-butt reality master!! I would rather die than be imaginative. I mean that.
Jake says  Eh. Your loss. Beat AAAH!!! Lava!! Lava all around us!! Panicking and jumping around Lava on the floor!
"Finn says  Shut up, man..."
"Jake says  Seriously, man! There must be an enchantment on the house or somethin'!"
"Finn says  I'm not playing you child-style games, guy. Watch and learn as I master... reality. Moves his foot nearer and nearer to the floor"
Jake says  NOOOOO!!
Finn says  Places foot on floor; it suddenly catches fire AAAAH!!! Putting fire out Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Jake! What the hey-hey?!
"Jake says  I was just playin' around with my imagination... In Jake's view, everything is on fire and lava is on the floor ...and then everything got intense."
Finn says  It's like... whatever you imagine becomes real... That's bananas!
Jake says  To himself Don't imagine blowin' apart my own brain... Don't imagine my eyeballs coming alive and flying around with rocket packs...
"Finn says  Dude! Imagine that BMO invented a better video game, and that he has new batteries."
Everything in the room begins to melt.
Finn and Jake says  WHOA!
Finn says  But first stop imagining lava!
Jake says  I can't! My imagination's too amazing!
Finn says  Imagine turning your imagination off!
"Jake says  I can't, dude... but I think I can imagine an imagination turning-off machine... that is upstairs, surrounded by a crud-load of traps, ghosts, monsters, and poison fountains, and... and... girls. Cute girls, and hamsters."
Finn says  Can't you make it easier to get to that machine?
"Jake says  You can't hold this baby back! That's bad parenting, mamma!"
Finn says  Then it's up to me to take your imagination downtown! Let's go to the den and suit up!
Jake says  Neat! Finn and he enter the den Grab that missile.
Finn says  Okay.
Jake says  And... get that cosmic gauntlet.
Finn says  Nah. There's a better one over by the desk. Ah! UNH! Finn leaps into an invisible wall. What did I just hit?!
Jake says  I'm imagining a wall. You can just go around it.
"Finn says  Really? That's it? There isn't any invisible, angry troll or anything?"
"Jake says  Oh, there's one now. Troll roars Look out!"
"Finn says  Aah! I can feel it on my foot! They stumble over, and Finn's shoe seemingly floats in midair. I'll kill you, troll! Yah! Yah! Yah, yah, yah, yah!"
Jake says  You're kickin' too high! He's shorter than you!
"Finn says  Yah, yah! Finn's blows finally start to land."
"Jake says  Alright! You're gettin' him, man! Finn continues attacking Uh-oh. Now you're uppercutting his family. Finn kicks in the air and a scream is heard. Heh heh heh heh heh! You just kicked his wife in the face! Troll wife yells incomprehensibly. She's comin' back for revenge."
Finn says  Cram this! We gotta book it to your imagination machine! Yah!
Finn leaps out the window into the knife storm.
"Jake says  The knife storm, remember?!?! Finn frantically pulls himself and Jake up to the attic. They rest and pant heavily. Oh, boy... Ooh... Finn, I found some candy. Eats some It tastes like banana candy, man. Sips drink Here, man. Try some."
Finn eats some candy.
Finn says  Standing up Okay. Try to imagine some kind of steel umbrella over the bridge so... we don't get knifed.
Jake says  Okay! Does it It is done.
"Finn says  Walks out cautiously Haha! Ha! Hey, you did it, man!"
"Riddle Master says  No, voyagers. To pass this bridge, you must first pass the test of the riddle."
Finn says  To Jake An imaginary riddle master?
Jake laughs sillily.
"Finn says  Sighs Ask me your riddle, Riddle Master. I accept your test."
"Riddle Master says  Then brace yourself, fool, for this riddle comes from a mysterious, far-away land."
Finn says  Ready LAY IT ON ME!!
"Riddle Master says  Yes, um... The riddle, uh... It... cometh... uh..."
Jake says  I can't imagine a riddle.
"Finn says  Dude, just make it super easy."
"Riddle Master says  THE RIDDLE COMETH! Tell me, voyager. What is simple, and yet also... a riddle?"
"Finn says  Man, that riddle sucks."
Riddle Master says  THAT IS THE WRONG ANSWER!! The penalty is... DEATH BY SNAKES!!
"Finn says  YEAH, RIGHT! I'VE GOT A MISSILE!!"
Finn launches it and it explodes on the other side of the bridge. Finn and Jake scream in pain.
Jake says  You exploded the snakes right at us!!
Finn says  I can feel them all over my face! Imaginary poison coursing through my veins!!
"Jake says  I'm sorry, brother! I'm so sorry!"
Finn says  Let's just get to your imagination machine and we'll be okay!!
"Jake says AAH! A big bowl of baby elephants, chainsaws, and doo-doo's flyin' towards us!! JUMP, DUDE!! Finn evades the obstacle. Here come's a soul-eater! Snap its neck! Finn jumps up and does so. A weapon is heard charging up. Jake gasps. The Bazooka Goblin has you in its sights!"
Finn says  Hey! Don't shoot us with that bazooka!
Bazooka Goblin laughs.
Finn says  Don't you do it...
Bazooka Goblin continues laughing.
"Finn says  DON'T DO IT, MAN!!!"
Bazooka Goblin says  Hee... heehee... hee... Okay.
Jake says  YEAH!
"Finn says  AW, YEAH!"
Finn and Jake laugh and do a celebratory fist bump.
"Finn says  Alright, use your powers or something. This poison is about to kill me."
Jake says  Alright. Goin' up. Check it. My imagination-off machine is left of the bed.
Finn says  Is it clear?
"Jake says  Yeah, I mean there's a bunch of cute girls... but they shouldn't bother you."
"Finn fidgets around and mumbles to himself ""Ah... where, ah... Where is this, I ca—Ah... man."" before finding the machine."
Finn says  Oh! I found the shut-off lever!
"Jake says  Cool, man! Invisible girl giggles. Dang, girl. If you weren't a figment of my imagination, I'd want to have your baby. Another girl giggles. What're you laughin' at?"
Finn says  Alright. I'm gonna turn it off. Finn is suddenly hit by an invisible force. UNH!! You said it was clear of danger!!
Jake says  Dude... I can't see anything... I must've imagined... an invisible monster!!
"Finn says  What?! Well, how do I kill it?! Finn gets beaten down."
"Jake says  I'm comin', buddy! Alright, Invisibo. Eat a piece of this! Punches it Hurry, Finn! Get to the lever!"
"Finn says  Okay! I'm doin' iiiit!! Finn pulls the lever; Jake falls down; Finn's wounds are healed. Aw, yeah! The imaginary poison is gone, Jake! Jake? Jake groans. Hey, come on. Wake up, man."
Finn pats Jake a few times.
"Jake says  Completely regular tone Hello, Finn. I am awake and healthy."
Finn says  Jake... what happened to your bombastic personality?
Jake says  I do not know what you mean. I am perfectly bombastic.
"Finn says  Nah, man, nah. Somethin's wrong. Tell me something amazing!"
"Jake says  But Finn, I cannot tell you something amazing as there is nothing amazing happening around us that I could describe for you."
"Finn says  Ah, see, man, you suck now! Crap, it's your imagination. You need that thing. Sighs"
Jake reaches for his viola and plays a continuous G♮
"Finn says  Jake... Stop it, man. You're just playing one continuous note."
Jake says  One note is all that is needed.
Finn says  Scoffs I'm gonna turn your imagination back on. Fidgets around and mumbles to self Jake! Your imagination on-off switch has vanished!
Jake says  True. Doth thou not remember shutting down mine imagination?
Finn says  I remembereth.
Jake says  I am happy that my imagination is gone. It was purposeless.
"Finn says  No! It was the opposite of that stuff. I know this now... Saddened ...only too late. Okay, man. I'm gonna try to imagine an imagination back-on switch for you, and so you know, if there's anything dainty inside my imagination, I'm gonna be mad. Imagination... go... Finn appears in his imagination land. What the stuff? Well... this isn't so bad. Imagination back-on machine appears Nothing lame, at least. Hey! And there's Jake's imagination switch!"
"Suddenly, the Lyre Player enters dancing and singing the Imagination Song."
"Finn says  Disappointed Cram. Oh! Maybe I can try imagining something. He imagines a penguin, and a bowl of spaghetti. The Lyre Player trips over the former and lands in the latter; Finn laughs. Now for that switch."
"Bellamy Bug says  Entering Good morrow, sir! My name is Bellamy Bug! Would you care for a crotchet doily my daughter made? She imbued it with her tears. You see, she recently broke up with a gentle dandy."
Finn says  No! How'd you get in my Imagination Land?!
"Bellamy Bug says  Giggles I don't know, my young fellow! You tell me. Perhaps I represent your secret desire to be civilized!"
Finn says  REPRESENT THIS! Smacks Bellamy And this. Imagines two arms protruding out of Bellamy one cephalopodic and one robotic which both punch him.
Bellamy says  Oh! I say! Oh! Ah! Ouch! Ah!
Penguins take Bellamy away.
"Finn says  Haha... Penguins... Hahahaha! Heh, alright. Runs over to the machine I hope this works, Jake! Pulls lever; Jake's imagination returns. Haha, yeah! A fairy comes near the machine giggling. Hey! Get away from that! Don't push that hyper drive button! The fairy pushes the button anyway with her butt"
Jake says  Jake's head grows rapidly Aaaah!! I can imagine EVERYTHING!!!
"Finn says  Frustrated sigh Take a hike, fairy! Normal style! Pushes ""NORMAL STYLE"" button"
"Jake says  Head shrinks Aw, man... I imagined my mom naked! Finn appears next to him. Yugh!"
Finn says  You okay?
"Jake says  I think so. Lemme check. Mmmm... Yup. She's clothed now. And hey, man! It's clear out now! We can go on an adventure!"
"Finn says  I don't know, dude. I think we got all the adventure we need right here... Thinking with... lava on the floor!"
Jake says  Huh?! Body starts melting AAH! AAH! MY LEGS ARE MELTING! Just kidding. Chuckles and reforms his body.
"Finn says  Hahahaha! Good dog. He pets Jake, and the episode ends."
"The episode begins with Finn, Jake, and the Swamp Giant falling from a great height. They are both gripping onto the giant."
Swamp Giant says  AAAAH!
"Finn says  Last chance, Swamp Giant! Tell us where you hid the Mini Queen!"
Swamp Giant says  NEVER!!
The three scream as they fall. Squeaking is heard.
"Finn says  Huh? He finds the Mini Queen. Hi, Mini Queen! Jake! I've got 'er!"
"Jake says  Then hold my hand, dude! Finn does so. Whoooop!"
"Jake inflates, making himself and Finn reach terminal velocity sooner and float gently to the ground."
Swamp Giant says  Aaaah! Oof!
The swamp giant hits the ground. Finn and Jake land on the flattened giant. Jake lets his air out and deflates.
Finn says  My inflatable angel.
Jake says  Heh heh heh. They jump off the giant. How's the Mini Queen?
"Finn says  I dunno. Can't understand a word she says. The Mini Queen promptly writes a message on Finn's hand that says, ""THANK YOU 4 SAVING ME, XOXO CALL ME."" The Mini Queen shapes her antennae to look like a heart. Aww! My pleasure, ma'am! I just like beating up evil! Finn performs a ""handshake"" with one of her antennae. She squeaks. Okay... Didn't... catch any of that either."
The Mini Queen jumps on Jake's nose and then leaps away.
Jake says  Sniffs Mini Queen must've stepped in somethin' funky. Sniffs No... It's not tiny feet I'm smelling! This way! He sniffs the ground and follows a scent. The scent leads him to a sword. Whoa!
Finn says  What?
Jake says  In awe Do you know whose sword this is?! This is the sword of Billy!
Finn says  Billy?!
Finn and Jake says  Singing BIIILLYYYYYY!!!
Flashback
Young Billy says  Nothung!
The sword comes to Billy and sparks lightning dramatically. The musical sequence begins.
Back in the present
"Finn says  Oh, yeah! That was the most mathematical thing ever!"
"Jake says  Oh, yeah! Hahaha! He fought a bear!"
Finn says  This is so cool!
He attempts to pull out the sword. The ground cracks and makes a hole in the side of the mountain appear.
Finn and Jake says  Whoa!
Finn says  It's Billy's legendary crack!
They go inside. They gasp as they are treated with Billy's presence.
Billy says  Sighs Hello.
Finn says  Whispering to Jake It's him! It's him!!
"Jake says  Whispering I know, I know! Be cool!!"
Billy says  Yep. It's me.
Finn says  Man! I'm such a huge nerd for you! Please take us on as hero apprentices!
Billy says  What for?
Finn says  So that we could learn to kick evil's butt... just like you!
Jake says  I wanna be the dog version of you!
"Billy says  Ahh, that'd be a waste of time."
Jake says  Heh. Yeah. I-I'm a little paunchy... but I could do some sit-ups!
"Billy says  No, I was talking about beating up monsters. It's as pointless as a dog chasing his own tail."
"Jake says  Heh. See, that's where you're wrong... 'cuz watch! He tries to catch his tail, of course to no avail. Ah... ah..."
"Finn says  What do you mean, ""pointless?"" We just saved the Mini Queen from a monster!"
"Billy says  You know where she is right now? She's probably being eaten by a different monster. She's probably dead. Finn gasps. In my youth, I was much like you. Motivated. Headstrong. Wore a silly, little outfit. Even had a magic dog."
Billy points to his skeleton of a dog.
"Jake says  Scared, yet smiling Heh... I'm gonna pass out... Falls backward"
"Billy says  All my life, I've beaten on evil creatures. Deep sigh But new evil keeps popping up. Kicking their butts was a hopeless effort!"
Jake says  What other way is there?
Billy says  Nonviolently. Help people by being active in your community.
Finn says  Nonviolently?? Sighs I gotta try being nonviolent... the Billy way...
"Jake says  Me, too!"
"Finn says  Billy, I won't let you down!"
"Jake says  I love you, Billy! I got a secret crush on you, Billy!"
They run away screaming. Billy sighs wearily. The scene shifts to the Grass Lands. Finn is riding on Jake.
"Finn says  This is gonna be tough, Jake. I'll have to suppress my every warrior instinct."
Jake says  Relax. It'll be easy not to beat up on monsters and still help people.
"Cobbler says  Help! Help! Finn and Jake notice his cries. A monster! The cobbler runs into Jake's leg. Jake retracts. Oh! Thank goodness! Heroes! I'm being chased by a horrible Dragon! Please, please help!"
"Finn says  Oh, uh..."
Jake says  Oh...
Cobbler says  Act quickly! He's almost upon us!
Jake says  Straightforward Sorry. We don't beat stuff up anymore.
"Cobbler says  No, but please! Stammers frantically"
Finn says  To Jake Dude. We gotta do something to help him.
Jake says  I could teach 'im how to not be such a spaz.
"Finn says  To cobbler Hey, Mister. Besides being chased by a monster, what else is wrong?"
Cobbler says  Well... I've been running all day. I guess I'm pretty hungry.
"Jake says  Say no more. Walking away, pulling Finn with him Come on, Finn."
Cobbler says  Where're you going?!
Jake says  To make you somethin' to eat!
They leave. The dragon arrives.
Cobbler says  AAAH!! NO!! HELP!!
The dragon attacks him by breathing fire. The scene transitions to a town where Finn and Jake are running a food stand.
Finn says  I still feel weird about not fighting off that dragon.
Jake says  Trust me. This is a way better way to help 'im. Yelling out Gruel! Get your free gruel!
Lady says  Walking up to stand What's this all about?
"Finn says  Free gruel, ma'am. I can't beat monster butts, but I can beat your hungry guts. That's for sure!"
Lady says  Hahaha! Eats gruel I didn't throw up! This gruel is very adequate.
Finn says  Victoriously YEAH!!!
Cut to the other townspeople eating Finn and Jake's gruel.
"Finn says  This is great, Jake!"
"Jake says  Yeah, we're really helpin' people!"
Finn says  Whoa! Look who it is!
The cobbler walks up to Finn and Jake. There are scorch marks on him.
Jake says  Dude! You're alive!
"Cobbler says  Angrily No thanks to you two!! That dragon chased me for two days!! ...And then I was lost for... uh, three days... and then I... I fell under a spell of a beautiful enchantress for... Unsure a week? So that's two, plus three, plus a week—"
Jake shushes him.
Jake says  Deliberate Dude. Gruel.
"Cobbler says  Oh, thank you! Eats it Hahahaha! Hahaha. His hand suddenly becomes encased in stone. AAAH! WHAT'S HAPPENING?!"
"Finn says  Huh? Holds up glass with potion in it Oh, that's probably the stone skin potion I added to the recipe. It gives your body the power to grow armor."
Cobbler says  Wha? Ah... uh?!
"More of his body becomes encased in stone. The cobbler strikes himself with a fork, and it has no effect. The cobbler panics."
Jake says  Dude... how much of that potion did you use?
Finn holds up five more empty potion bottles. The townspeople have grown armor as well. One of the townspeople's belly button starts shooting flames.
Townsperson says  AAAAH!! MY TUMMY IS BREATHING FIRE!!!
Finn says  To Jake Geez... I thought people would like that.
Cobbler says  Why?! Why would anyone want that?!
Finn says  So you can defend against evil monsters!
Cobbler says  You're supposed to beat up monsters so we don't have to defend ourselves!
"Finn says  No, see? I'm helping you nonviolently!"
Cobbler says  Helping?! I can't even move my hands! I'm a cobbler! How'm I supposed to cobble with these useless chunk mitts?!
"Finn says  Sooo... the village needs the help of a new cobbler, eh?"
Finn and Jake says  Thinking Hmmmmmm...
Cobbler says  WHAT?! NO—
Cut to the shoe-repair shop.
Finn says  Alright! We're cobblers!
"Cobbler says  No, you're not!! You're just watching my shop while I go to the dermatologist! Leaving And don't try to cobble anything!"
"Jake says  To Finn What does ""cobble"" mean, anyway?"
Finn says  I think it has something to do with shoes...
Fine Lady says  Entering shop Excuse me! Can you help me? I need a broken heel fixed. I'm going to a fancy funeral.
Finn says  Taking shoe and heel Of course I'll help!
Scene transition. Finn is hammering in the heel.
Finn says  There! Rolling over to lady Whah! He puts the shoe on her foot. Pa-kow!!
Fine Lady says  Ah!
"She seems content with the repair. Suddenly, a blade comes out of the shoe. The lady makes a small gasp."
Finn says  Now you can fight off evil if it shows up at the funeral!
Jake says  To Finn Did you fix that shoe with a magic nail?
"Finn says  Maybe... The shoe arms axes, an extra blade, and a lasso. Whoa!"
Jake says  Cool!
Fine Lady says  I cannot go to the funeral in these!
"Cobbler says  Entering shop Hey, everyone! I'm back from the doctor! The lady's shoe lace lasso's the cobbler. WHY?! The lace forces the cobbler to the ground."
Fine Lady says  To Finn and Jake ...And I'm not supposed to bring a guest.
Cobbler says  To Finn and Jake GET OUT!!
Cut to outside the shop.
"Finn says  Apparently, I suck at being nonviolent."
"Jake says  Dude, suckin' at somethin' is the first step towards bein' sorta good at somethin'. You and I are like little baby Billys right now, and we're ""sucking"" on our first bottle of nonviolent milk!"
"Finn says  Frustrated sigh Totes. I'll stop ""pooping"" my diaper."
"Jake says  Whoa, what?!"
Townsperson with fire-spitting belly button says  HELP! I NEED MEDICAL HELP!!
Finn says  Medical help? Hmmmmm...
The scene shifts to the hospital where Finn and Jake are doctors.
Finn says  How can we help?
Lumpy Space Princess says  I want surgery to make my body hot.
Finn says  Yikes...
"Lumpy Space Princess says  Yeah. I know I'm already pretty smokin'... but I bought this swimsuit, so I need a swimsuit body."
Jake says  Whistles To Finn You up for some serious plastic surgery?
The Adventure Time logo swirls onto the screen.
"Lumpy Space Princess comes out of the hospital with a new body, complete with legs."
"Lumpy Space Princess says  Aw, yeah! This body's hot! And powerful! Suddenly, machine parts form on her body like a cyborg. Huh?! Aw, what?! Her legs turns into a wheel. She makes pained noises."
"Jake says  Dude, did you use a magic nail again?"
Finn says  I've got three left!
Lumpy Space Princess says  Ohhhh... She gains a robotic eye. What did you do to me??
"Finn says  We transformed you into a cyborg fighter! That's hot, right?"
Lumpy Space Princess says  No one thinks this look is hot!!
The cobbler suddenly walks up.
"Cobbler says  To Lumpy Space Princess Oh, my laces! You're the most beautiful— He suddenly gets shot with a laser from her robotic eye."
Lumpy Space Princess says  Huh?!
"Her wheel activates, and she speeds into the cobbler. The townsperson with the flame-shooting belly button runs by again screaming."
Finn says  ...Jake...?
Jake says  ....Yeah...?
Finn says  I think us being nonviolent... is hurting people. Man... Billy is gonna be so bummed out...
"Jake says  Not if we run away, Finn! We'll have to live in halfway homes and be cannibals! We'll survive!"
Finn says  I just wanna sit here and moan.
"Jake says  Then I'll moan with ya, buddy."
"Finn says  Moaning Thaaaanks, buuuddy..."
Jake says  Moaning Yoooouuu'rrre weeeelcooome...
Finn and Jake notice more cries for help.
Old Lady says  AAAH! AAAH! HELP ME!!
Swamp Giant says  Hahaha! Relax! I'm just gonna grind you up!!
Old Lady says  AAAH! AAAH!
"Jake says  To Finn Aw, man, this grass-bag again?? Heroically HEY, EVIL-DOER! Weakly Um... could you keep your evil-doing quiet? Finn is dealing with some heavy stuff over here."
"Swamp Giant says  It's not evil!! When they get this old, they wanna be ground up!! Hahaha! Right, you old bat?!"
Old Lady says  Help!!
Finn sweats.
Swamp Giant says  Right?!?
"Finn strains, visibly in conflict."
Old Lady says  Oooh!! Aaah!!
Finn raises his fist.
"Finn says  Huh?? A fist raised in righteous anger?! Oh, no! It's my fist!! I've gotta think of a way to save this old lady without punchin' this guy in the face!! Hmmm..."
"Swamp Giant says  To Old Lady Yeah, you wanna get ground up, right?!?"
"Finn says  Furiously WRONG!!!! He punches and uppercuts the Swamp Giant, saving the Old Lady. Quietly, to Jake I couldn't think of anything..."
Old Lady says  Whooo! Falls in Finn's and Jake's arms
Finn says  POOP!! I saved her with violence...
"Old Lady says  What's your huff, son?"
Finn says  The greatest hero in the world told me to help people without being violent... and I promised I would do that and not let him down... but I did let 'im down.
"Old Lady says  Stuff and nonsense! You sure helped this old gal out! And you did it with violence! Like a true hero, you were born to punch evil creatures! Punches Finn Just like I was born to be an old lady! Don't deny your rowdy nature, paladins! Starts dancing And don't take advice from old people! Continues dancing"
Finn says  Yeah... Yeah...! YEAH!! That old lady has a point!
"Jake says  Wait, didn't she say not to take advice from old peo—"
Finn says  It's all so clear to me! Back to the cave of Billy!!
Jake says  Cha!!
Scene transition to Billy's cave.
Finn says  It's us again.
Jake says  And we've got exciting news!
"Billy says  Aw, I don't—I don't wanna buy anything."
"Finn says  Billy, an old lady told me that I shouldn't listen to you because you're old. Also, that I should do what I was born to do... which is kickin' buns."
Billy says  Don't you see how pointless it is? You know what's probably happening to that old lady right now? She's probably dead!
"Jake says  She's right here. Turns around, revealing her"
Old Lady says  Hello!
Billy gasps.
"Finn says  We saved 'er, Billy."
Jake says  You saved 'er.
"Finn says  I saved 'er, Billy. I saved 'er using violence. And that's not a bad thing, Billy! This old lady is alive because of these! Holds up fists and leg And look how happy she is, man! She's elated!"
"Billy says  Hmm. Perhaps you're right. Pained groan It's... it's as if your words are filling a void in my very being... You wanna watch? He reveals a literal void in his stomach. Finn and Jake gasp. The hole starts filling up with body mass. Nothung! The sword comes back once again. Finn and Jake... truly, you are my heroes. They laugh excitedly. Now you're freakin' me out... Finn, Jake, and the old lady climb on Billy enthusiastically. Finn and Jake are taken off."
Jake says  We're his heroes!!
Billy looks at the old lady.
Billy says  Huh... Hello.
"Jake says  Ha! Haha! I love you, Billy!!"
Billy says  Get outta here!!
"Finn and Jake run out quickly, laughing heartily. As Finn and Jake happily wander off, Billy nods contentedly. The episode comes to a close."
"The episode begins with Finn walking through some bushes, looking for Jake."
Finn says calling Jake! Jake! coming out of bushes Jake? sees Jake's viola resting on a rock Hmmm... picks it up and starts playing it poorly
"Jake says off screen Aaaah! comes out of bushes covering his ears Aaaaah! rolls on ground Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl! gets up and knocks the viola out of Finn's hands Uh! That sounded horrible, man! picks up viola"
Finn says I don't know how to play.
Jake says Exactly! starts tuning viola
Distant screams are heard off screen.
Finn says Huh? Let's go! runs toward screaming
"Jake says Oh, wait up. I gotta finish tuning my viola."
Scene changes to Finn running toward the Soft Village. He enters it and sees several Soft People crying.
Finn says Soft People! Why are you all in a tizzy?
Soft Person #1 says The Gut Grinder! He's back!
"Finn says The ""Gut Grinder?"""
"Old Soft Person says Yes, the Gut Grinder is a gold-eating monster. In the past, the Soft People of this village enjoyed piling our gold in the center of town and dancing wildly around it. It was awesome laughs! But then, the Gut Grinder came and stole our pile of gold. So we adapted and learned how to hide our gold using a big cup. And it worked! The Gut Grinder didn't come back! But recently, and admittedly it was probably a bad idea, we took our gold out from under the cup and we put it in the center of town. Haha, 'cause--'cause we really like dancing around it! But, boy oh boy, was that a mistake. You know what happened?"
Finn says Uhhh... it came back and ate all your gold?
"Old Soft Person says crying Yes, oh, yes!"
"Finn says Aw, don't cry, Soft Old Man. I'll find this monster and bring peace to this village. I swear!"
Soft Person #1 says Swear to what?
Finn says I swear to justice!
Soft People says Whoa! He swears to justice!
"Finn says Okay, so, what does he look like?"
"Old Soft Person says Ohh, it's so scary we usually close our eyes and go wee-wee when he attacks. But... walks over to footprint he left this footprint... Jake giant-sized storms in Wha--?"
"Jake says putting his foot in the print Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!"
Soft Person #1 says Look! His paw matches the footprint!
"Soft People start murmuring, terrified."
"Soft Person #1 says I'm so scared, I'm gonna go wee-wee!"
"Finn says Whoa, no, no-no-no-no! Calm down, everybody. This is my friend, Jake the Dog."
Soft Person #2 says sigh Thank goodness.
Soft Person #1 says Yeah--I almost wee-wee'd!
"Jake says Wait, you were gonna wee-wee if I was the Gut Grinder?"
"Soft Person #1 says Oh, yeah! We're terrified of him."
Jake says loudly Then I am the Gut Grinder!
Soft Person #1 says I'm gonna wee-wee! squirts liquid out of its armpits and spins around in a circle
Finn says laugh That guy wee-wees weird.
"Jake says I'm just kiddin', everybody. I'm not the Gut Grinder. I'm... shrinks back to normal size Jake the Dog! Woohoo!"
"Soft Person #3 says Aw, he's just a cute little dog!"
"Jake says Hey, I'm not cute!"
"Soft Child says running up to Jake Doggy! petting Jake Pet, pet, pet! laughs"
"Jake says Huh? Oh, heheh. closes his eyes, purrs, drools"
Finn says Pfft.
Jake says What?!
"Finn says I didn't say anything. to villagers People of the village of Soft People, I, Finn, and my buddy Jake, will find this monstrous monster and slay it!"
Soft People cheer.
"Finn says Come on, let's go, Jake."
Jake says getting a belly rub Oh... heheh. What? No! Finn grabs him and drags him away Noooo...
"Soft Child says Bye-bye, doggy!"
"Jake says still being dragged by Finn Bye, Soft Village."
Scene changes to Finn and Jake following the footprints. Jake is walking in them.
"Jake says Hey Finn, my feet fit these prints pretty well. Hm, what if I really am the Gut Grinder? laughs nervously"
"Finn says Dude, your paws'll fit anything."
Jake says laugh That is true. Check this out. shrinks his feet to fit Finn's prints and walks in them; says mockingly says I'm Finn the Human and I stink at viola!
Finn says imitating Jake I'm Jake the Dog and I put my nose in poop.
Jake says There's a lot of interesting smells in poop.
Commotion is heard in the distance.
Finn says Huh? sees that it's coming from Cube Village
Scene switches to Finn inside Cube Village.
"Finn says Hey Cube People, what's going on here?"
Cube Person #1 says The Gut Grinder stormed into our village and ate all of our gold!
"Jake says emerging from behind a building Wait, what happened?"
Cube People says Aaah! The Gut Grinder!
"Finn says Whoa, no, no, no! He's not the Gut Grinder! He's my friend!"
Cube Person #2 says We saw the Gut Grinder and he looks exactly like him!
Jake says laughs nervously Th-that's ridiculous.
"Finn says Jake, back to your normal size."
"Jake says Oh yeah. shrinks down, starts dancing Ooh ooh ooh. sings I am not... the Gut Grinder. Ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh."
"Cube Person #1 says Aw, he's just a cute little dog."
Jake says Hey! Y'all are the ones who are cute. I'm hot.
"Cube Person #1 says Aw, look--he's all mad!"
Cube Person #2 says Even cuter.
Jake says Aaah!
"Cube Person #1 says running over to Jake So cute! hugs him, rubs his belly Aw, so cute, so cute!"
"Jake says I'm not cute! I'm--mnh, closes eyes ooh."
Finn says We are also seeking the Gut Grinder. Me and my friend Jake will find it and slay it! Tell us what he looked like.
"Cube Person #2 says Exactly like him, points to Jake but bigger."
"Jake says getting belly rubbed Ruff, ruff, grrrr... continues making dog sounds"
Finn says Huh... Which way did he go?
Cube People point left.
"Finn says Jake! Hey, come on!"
Jake says Wha--? getting up Where am I?
"Finn says running left Thanks, guys!"
Jake says following Finn I'm not cute. I'll mess you up.
Scene changes to Finn riding Jake through a field.
Jake says Finn...? What if I am the Gut Grinder?
Finn says What?!
"Jake says What if I'm, like, stealing gold in my sleep?"
Finn says You can't be stealing gold in your sleep--I watch you while you sleep.
"Jake says Wha--? Yo, Finn, that is creepy, man."
Finn says I can't help it. I take pictures.
"Jake says Well, when do you sleep?"
Finn says Justice never sleeps.
"Jake says Well, there's gotta be a time when you're not watchin' me... that--that I--that I might be stealin' gold unconsciously!"
Finn says into Jake's ear You... are... not... the... Gut... Grinder!
Jake says worried moan
An alarm starts sounding. Finn and Jake see that it is coming from the Spiky Village.
Alarm says City in danger! City in danger!
"Finn says Let's go! Oh, wait--what if these guys think you're the Gut Grinder? Hmm... snaps fingers Ah-ha! reaches into his pack Got the perfect thing for ya says pulls out glasses Groucho glasses! places glasses on a lump of Jake's fat"
"Jake says I love it! kisses lump, hides his face by moving it to his chest Launch in 3, 2, 1! jumps toward Spiky Village"
Finn says Woohoo! Yeah!
They enter Spiky Village. Several Spiky People are seen crying.
"Finn says Oh, man! These people are a mess!"
Spiky Guard says Halt! Identify yourselves immediately!
Finn says I am Finn the hero!
Jake says moving lump I'm Groucho!
Finn says We're on a mission to catch the Gut Grinder.
Spiky Guards says gasp
Spiky Mayor says I am the mayor of this village. Our gold has just been stolen by the very monster you speak of.
Finn says I hereby vow to catch that thief and bring your gold back!
Spiky Mayor says Our people thank you. I present to you this photo Spiky Person enters carrying a photograph of the Gut Grinder to help in your mission.
"Finn says takes photo Oh, thanks."
"Jake says quietly Wha--? looking at photo Finn, it's me!"
"Finn says crumbles photo into a ball; says quietly says Well, duh, it looks like you. puts photo in pocket We already knew that. It's just one of those weird coincidences--like how my belly button looks like your face."
"Jake says Yeah, I-I know you think it does, Finn--but this is different. I'm scared, Finn. starts shaking nervously"
"Finn says Jake, stop it!"
Jake accidentally shakes off the Groucho glasses.
"Spiky Mayor says Wha--? Oh, it's the Gut Grinder!"
Spiky People start murmuring angrily and surround Finn and Jake.
"Finn says No, no-no-no-no! He's not the Gut Grinder! I swear on my good name... and justice... and Jake's cute face!"
Jake bats his eyelids.
Spiky Mayor says His face is weird. The truth is obvious says your friend is the Gut Grinder!
Spiky People take Jake.
Finn says NOOOOOO!
Spiky Mayor says as Spiky People put Jake in jail. You are under arrest for stealing our gold.
Finn says running up to Jake I'll get you out of here... somehow.
"Jake says No, Finn... I belong behind bars. Look at the evidence--I really am the Gut Grinder."
"Finn says Buddy, listen to me. You've been my best friend for as long as I can remember! That's enough evidence to prove to me that you're not a monster!"
Jake says Then... why am I in jail? Only Gut Grinders go to jail.
Old Man Prisoner says I'm in jail and I'm not the Gut Grinder. catches a grub I'm here for the free grub. puts grub in his mouth Hehehehehe! his gold tooth gleams
"Finn says Huh? Wait, I got an idea!"
"Finn reaches through the bars and pulls out the old man's tooth and runs to the middle of town, holding up the tooth."
"Finn says Hey, Gut Grinder! I got some gold here that you missed. Come and get it!"
A manhole cover rattles nearby. Out pops a cute dog face.
"Finn says Huh. Whoa, you're the Gut Grinder?"
"The face shoots out sharp points and rises up. It turns out to be a mace held by the Gut Grinder, who climbs out of the manhole. The Gut Grinder growls and sees the gold tooth in Finn's hand. He chases Finn, punches him, and steps on him, taking the tooth and laughing. The scene switches to inside the jail."
"Old Man Prisoner says rubbing Jake's belly Oh, Gut Grinder. Oh, Gut Grinder... you're a little cutesy. You're a little cutesy-wootsy."
"Jake says Huh? Grrrr... not cute. thinking Am I the Gut Grinder? looks through bars at Gut Grinder stepping on Finn All the clues fit! sees gold tooth I must be the Gut Grinder! as Gut Grinder, aloud And I want GOLD!"
"Jake grows huge, breaks out of jail, runs over to the Gut Grinder and kicks him, sending the gold tooth into the air."
"Finn says catching tooth Woohoo! Yeah! We got him! Thanks for saving me, Jake!"
Jake says as Gut Grinder Grrrr! I'm not Jake--I'm the Gut Grinder! Now give me that gold tooth!
Finn says What? Jake? Jake chomps at him Whoa!
"Finn runs away and accidentally rips his pack on a spike, spilling its contents. Jake corners him."
Finn says panting Whoa!
Jake says as Gut Grinder Rawr! Now give me that tooth!
"Finn says If I give you this stupid tooth, will you stop being a crazy jerk?!"
"Jake says snatches tooth, tosses it into his mouth, and laughs while walking away"
"Finn says What the--? Jake! You never turn into a monster when I want you to. It's always, ""Not now, Finn. I have a headache."" Oh, Jake, picks up viola your viola is all I have now. plays it screechily"
"Jake says as Gut Grinder Huh? comes back Ah, stay away from my viola!"
"Finn says Jake, you remember your viola!"
"Jake says as Gut Grinder I also remember that you stink hard at playing it. And dookie is radical, man! I don't care what anyone says. shakes head; normal voice Wha--huh? What? Where am I? Finn, is that you?"
"Finn says Who else would it be, baby?"
Jake says Whoo! shrinks to normal size I guess I went nuts.
"Finn says You were so crazy, man! Like--like, actually crazy."
"Jake says burps up tooth, laughs"
Finn says patting Jake's back It's good to have you back.
Jake says It's good to have you pat my back.
"Finn says scratching Jake Man, if I had known you were so easily manipulated, I would have eaten more of your ice cream."
Jake says pushes Finn away Cut it out!
Scene changes to Gut Grinder. Spiky People surround it.
Spiky Person says Cut open the Gut Grinder's belly!
Something starts moving inside the Gut Grinder. It rips open and gold spills out.
"Spiky Mayor says What the--? Sharon comes out of the pile of gold What the--? Sharon, what are you doing in the Gut Grinder?"
Spiky People says murmuring That's the mayor's wife!
Spiky Mayor says holding skin And the Gut Grinder's skin is not skin at all--it's cloth! Sharon! Have you been sewing?!
"Sharon says unapologetically Yes, Cameron. I've been stealing gold."
"Spiky Mayor says WHY, SHARON?!"
"Sharon says Because I like to buy things, Cameron! I like to shop! And I dressed up like Jake because I think he's hot."
Spiky People gasp. Jake raises his eyebrows up and down.
"Spiky Mayor says You have been a naughty girl, Sharon. turns to guards Guards! Throw my wife in jail. turns to Finn and Jake Finn and Jake, thank you for saving my Spiky Village."
"Finn says gives thumbs up No problem, mayor."
Spiky Mayor says Now give us a hug.
Spiky People laugh and advance toward Finn and Jake.
"Finn says No, don't do that! Don't hug us! Spiky People start hugging Don't touch me! AAAAAAAAAH!"
Jake says Ow! Hey! Don't touch us! OWWWW!
