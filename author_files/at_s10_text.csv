0,The episode opens at the Royal Candy Vault in the Candy Kingdom. It is night time. Two Banana Guards stand watch outside the dormitory.
1,Right Guard says I'm scared it'll come back tonight.
2,Left Guard says Me too.
3,Right Guard says Can we hold hands?
4,Left Guard says I need my hand to hold my spear.
5,Right Guard says Why don't you use your other hand?
6,"Left Guard says Oh, that's a good idea. He holds out his hand."
7,Right Guard says But... I need this hand to hold my spear.
8,Left Guard says Use your other one.
9,"Right Guard says Tries to reach the other guard's left hand with his own left hand. Aw, it won't reach."
10,Left Guard says Oh no.
11,Right Guard says Wait! He turns around to face the wall so that they can hold each other's left hands.
12,Left Guard says Oh-
13,Both guards says Together Oh!
14,Left Guard says Hooray.
15,Right Guard says Facing the wall This is less scary because now I won't see the monster coming.
16,"A growling is heard. The guard facing the wall hears it, but the guard on the left doesn't because he has been distracted by his own spear."
17,"Left Guard says Wow. You know, I just noticed these things have rings on the end. It must be for blowing bubbles. Twirls spear."
18,"They both scream as they are snatched away by the hand of a monster. There is a slurping sound and they go quiet. Brown ooze begins to seep towards the dormitory entrance, followed by the monster itself. It pushes the doors open, where there are many banana guards sleeping in bunks. It grabs one of them."
19,Banana Guard says Huh? Screams It's back!
20,"The monster hisses and spits ooze onto the guard's face, muffling him. He grabs another guard and does the same."
21,Banana Guard says Huh?
22,"The monster grabs a third guard, but it shapeshifts and is revealed to be Jake the Dog in disguise."
23,"Jake says Surprise! He bites the monster's hand and latches on. Finn, get in here! He and the monster continue fighting."
24,Finn sits up from one of the bunks. He is also in a banana guard disguise.
25,"Finn says Hmm. Okay. Yeah! He draws his sword. Sic em, Jake! Ha! He jumps down from the bunk onto the monster's chest, where Jake has it pinned down."
26,"Jake says Feeling good, buddy?"
27,Finn says I'm good. But this chump's about to get slain!
28,Jake says Struggling to keep the monster's arms restrained. Slay him quick. He's got crazy devil strength!
29,Finn says No prob. Here comes the slay...
30,"As Finn looks into the monster's eyes, he hallucinates the face of Fern superimposed over it."
31,"Fern face says Don't kill me, Finn."
32,Finn says Um... Here I go! Unconvincing enthusiasm Mathematical!
33,"Jake says Finn, are you doing the thing?"
34,Fern face says I'm your friend. I'm you.
35,"Finn says Jake, maybe you should slay this guy?"
36,"Jake says Aw, dude, you are doing the thing again!"
37,Fern face says I'm you!
38,The sound of a weed whacker begins to grow in volume.
39,Jake says Slay him!
40,"Suddenly, the scene cuts to a flashback. A time card reads ""That morning."" Finn and Princess Bubblegum are walking through the Candy Kingdom together, both wearing baseball kit."
41,Princess Bubblegum says Thanks again for coming out to coach. The jamboree's always a big morale boost for the troops.
42,"Finn says Yeah. It's, uh, a nice distraction."
43,Princess Bubblegum says Hmm. So how are you holding up after all the Fern stuff?
44,"Finn says It's been a rough month, PB. I know Fern was an angry guy who tried to kill me, but I still feel awful about the way he went. It's really messing with me."
45,"Princess Bubblegum says Oh, Finn, I'm so sorry. Death is no laughing mat- She suddenly slips on an oversized banana peel and comedically falls to the ground. She examines the sticker on the banana peel. Banana guard number 216?! Oh my glob, he's dead! She sees more peels, covered in brown ooze. This is a banana fudge massacre!"
46,A group of banana guards approach them in a panic.
47,Banana Guards says Together Princess?! Princess?!
48,"Princess Bubblegum says Guys, what happened?!"
49,Banana Guard says A terrible monster kidnapped squadron five!
50,"Another Banana Guard says It looked like a banana, but it peeled other bananas!"
51,"All says Together Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Traitor, traitor!"
52,"Princess Bubblegum says A banana and fudge monster?! That's candy tech. Okay, who's behind this? She turns to Finn. Finn! I need you and Jake to guard the barracks tonight. If this creep comes back and lays a finger on my guards, you show no mercy."
53,"Finn says Um... Yeah, I'll... do my best."
54,The flashback ends. Finn is still poised to strike down the monster. The buzzing of the weed whacker continues.
55,"Jake says Finn! Finn, stop showing mercy!"
56,"The monster manages to break Jake's grip and frees its hands, then kicks Finn off its chest."
57,"Finn says Oh, no! I dinked it!"
58,"The monster roars and shrieks at them, and then breaks through a wall and flees into the night. All the banana guards leap down from their bunks and begin running away in a panic. Jake is lying deflated on the ground."
59,"Finn says Jake, I'm sorry! I- I couldn't do it!"
60,"Jake says Pained Love you forever, man, but your guilt's hurting the team dynamics."
61,Finn says I know. I'm gonna go make it right! He exits in pursuit of the monster.
62,Jake says Cool. I'm gonna make peace with my aging body.
63,"Finn watches the monster run away into the night. He shakes himself and sets off in pursuit. He catches up, climbs onto the back of the monster's neck, and raises his sword."
64,"Finn says No mercy this time, banana boy! I don't care why you're doing this or if you have a... a tragic past. Fern's face appears again I don't care! I'm hard like that."
65,"Fern face says Don't kill me, Finn."
66,Finn says Growls Nope!
67,"He gives up, taking his sword away from the monster's neck. The monster notices him and screeches."
68,"Finn says Oh, gross!"
69,The monster headbutts him off its neck and into some nearby bushes.
70,Finn says What the heck is my problem?!
71,The monster turns and spits fudge at him.
72,"Finn says Aw, fudge!"
73,"It seems like the fudge is going to hit Finn, but it is deflected by a mysterious projectile and lands on the monster's own face."
74,Finn says Huh?! How'd I do that?!
75,"The monster retreats. Huntress Wizard suddenly appears next to Finn, hanging upside down from a tree."
76,"Huntress Wizard says Um, it's getting away."
77,"Finn says Aah! Oh, Huntress Wizard!"
78,"Huntress Wizard says Hey, Finn. She uses a magic arrow to create a vine in the direction of the monster. Come on! After that booger!"
79,"Finn climbs onto her back and Huntress Wizard hops onto the vine, going in pursuit of the monster again."
80,"Finn says Thanks for the save, HW."
81,Huntress Wizard says Mm-hmm.
82,"Finn says You're chasing that grabby banana too, huh?"
83,Huntress Wizard says I'm hunting it. It's an invasive species that's been destroying the local ecosystem with its nasty hot fudge. It's name is the Grumbo. It's a name that I made up just now... because you can't hunt what you can't name.
84,"Finn says Yeah, makes sense."
85,Huntress Wizard says Hmm.
86,Finn says Small talking So how you been?
87,"Huntress Wizard says Finn, I saw you falter back there. Why did you hesitate before you dealt the final blow?"
88,"Finn says Sighs It keeps happening since I aced Fern. Every time I'm about to wail on some monster, I remember seeing Fern go kaboom... and the guilt paralyzes me. I can't seem to final blow anybody."
89,A flashback to Fern's death is shown while Finn talks.
90,"Huntress Wizard says I see. Okay, let's vanquish your mental block. Because I'll need your help to defeat the Grumbo. It's a two-huntress job."
91,Finn says The second huntress is me.
92,Huntress Wizard says Yes.
93,"Huntress Wizard leaps down from the vine, startling a fat squirrel which is eating the fudge left behind by the Grumbo."
94,"Huntress Wizard says The trail goes gold here. I mean, the fudge is still hot, but that squirrel dude just ate most of it."
95,"Finn says Climbing off her back. What? No! Ugh, I should have struck when I had the chance! Or not struck Fern when I didn't have the chance? Ugh! I don't even know anymore."
96,"Huntress Wizard says This is just me talking, but it sounds like Fern was already headed down a dark road. Sounds like he was a bad version of yourself that you had to destroy in order to become an even tighter version of yourself. Does that sounds about right?"
97,They hear a distant whimpering and follow it to a cave.
98,"Huntress Wizard says Looks like we got some hot fudge on our hands. Okay, let's review our roles. When I take out its legs, you strike the underbelly. Got it?"
99,"Huntress Wizard manifests a javelin, and Finn draws his sword. They enter the cave."
100,Finn says I can do this. I'm 90% sure I can do this. Gonna slice right through that sweet Fern face.
101,Huntress Wizard says Shh!
102,"The whimpering continues, and the Grumbo can be heard snoring. Finn and Huntress Wizard find it asleep, hanging from the roof of the cave."
103,Huntress Wizard says Ready?
104,Finn says Unconvincingly Yes.
105,"Huntress hurls her javelin at the Grumbo, but it wakes up and dodges the attack. It drops to the floor to face its attackers."
106,Huntress Wizard says Duck - I guess.
107,Finn says Huh?
108,"Huntress Wizard avoids the Grumbo's headbutt, but Finn fails to react and is thrown across the room. Huntress runs up to the creature and kicks it in the chin."
109,Huntress Wizard says Bicycle kick!
110,She manifests an arrow with rope and uses it to bind the Grumbo's legs together. It crashes to the floor.
111,"Huntress Wizard says Now, Finn! Coop-degrassi!"
112,"Finn says Okay, time to final blow it!"
113,"He leaps onto the Grumbo's neck with a battlecry and raises his sword. Once again, Fern's face appears."
114,"Fern face says Finn, don't you love me?"
115,"Finn says To Huntress Uh, can we maybe switch roles?"
116,Huntress Wizard says Struggling to keep the Grumbo bound Not again.
117,The Grumbo punches Finn away and catapults Huntress Wizard into a wall. The vines binding its legs discorporate.
118,Finn says Oops! Oops. Oops. Oops!
119,The Grumbo spits fudge at Finn. He leaps over the projectile and it sears his lower regions.
120,"Finn says High pitch voice HW, let's come back and try tomorrow!"
121,Huntress Wizard says To herself Okay...
122,"She throws another javelin at the Grumbo, distracting it from its attack against Finn. She stands T-posed, allowing it to charge at her."
123,"Finn says Huntress Wizard, get out of the way!"
124,"Huntress Wizard remains where she is, watching the creature approach and doing nothing in response."
125,"Finn says Think, think, think! Growls Okay, if I can't fix my mind, I gotta fool it. He points his sword at Huntress Wizard and thinks to himself. Attack. Attack. Attack."
126,Fern's face appears superimposed over Huntress Wizard's.
127,"Fern face says Finn, help me."
128,"Finn says I'll save you, buddy."
129,"Finn chases the monster and finally sinks his sword into its underbelly. It screeches and collapses, its huge body finally coming to rest just inches from Huntress Wizard's face. Fern pulls his sword from its belly with a grunt. The Grumbo's body bursts, covering Finn, Huntress, and the cave in banana goop. Finn's sword disintegrates from being covered in hot fudge."
130,Finn says I did it. Sorry I almost got you killed.
131,Huntress Wizard says It's cool. It's totally cool. I knew you just needed a push. That's why I very smartly pretended to throw myself in harm's way. She take's Finn's hand and helps him up.
132,"Finn says No, actually, that's not what did it."
133,"Huntress Wizard says Yeah, right. We both know you're totally in love with me."
134,"Finn smiles, and they kiss. When Finn opens his eyes, Fern is superimposed over Huntress Wizard's face again, and he gives a high pitched scream. A group of peeled banana guards emerge from another part of the cave, groaning."
135,"Banana Guard says Finn? Are you here to rescue us? Oh, glob! There's someone else here too!"
136,"Another Guard says I don't have my peel! Don't look, don't look anyone! The banana guards continue indistinctly, embarrassed."
137,"Finn says It's okay, guys. Huntress Wizard is into natchy living."
138,Huntress Wizard says Weird. These Grumbo remains are 100% artificial candy flesh - like straight out of a lab.
139,Finn says I wonder who made him.
140,A camera watches them from above. The scene changes to the ziggurat.
141,"Mysterious character says Who indeed? Who is the brilliant puppet master working tirelessly behind the scenes, completely unfazed by this minor, minor setback? He crosses out a picture of the Grumbo. Why, it's me - Uncle G. Ready yourself, Princezzin! Your boy hero will be no match for my next creation."
142,An unknown monster is seen twitching in a tank.
143,The episode opens in the Tree House. Finn is eating cereal and Jake is sipping coffee.
144,Finn says Takes a spoonful of cereal and munches twice.
145,Jake says Slurps
146,Finn says Huh?
147,Jake says I was just sipping my coffee.
148,Finn says Oh. Takes a spoonful of cereal and munches twice.
149,Jake says Slurps
150,Finn says Munching
151,Jake says Slurp
152,Finn says Munching
153,Jake says Slurp
154,"Both of them notice the pattern and begin repeating it rhythmically. On the third repeat, Finn only munches his cereal once, tricking Jake into sipping early and breaking the pattern. They both laugh. BMO joins them."
155,BMO says I am also excited about today.
156,"Jake says Oh, yeah?"
157,BMO says Today is the first day of my new job.
158,"Finn says What's your new job, BMO?"
159,"Jake says Yeah, are you a spy? You know, 'cause of the overcoat?"
160,BMO says I'm a door-to-door salesman.
161,Finn and Jake says Together Oh.
162,Jake says What are you selling?
163,"BMO says I've got so many great things. Like for the man about town, this piece of lint."
164,Jake says I'll take it! He takes the lint.
165,"BMO says Hooray, my first sale! That'll be four doubloons."
166,Jake says Can I pay you later?
167,"BMO says Mm, the customer is always right!"
168,"Jake says Good attitude, BMO."
169,"BMO says Well, gentlemen... got to chop that wood."
170,"BMO stands up clumsily, revealing that someone else is inside the overcoat and BMO is sitting on their head, pretending they are his own body. ""BMO"" almost knocks a glass off the table, but Finn catches it. He notices Ice King's robes and feet sticking out the bottom of the overcoat."
171,Finn says Whispering to Jake It's Ice King.
172,Jake says Whispering back I know.
173,Ice King says Peeks his face out the front of the overcoat and spots that Finn and Jake have seen him. Oh! He quickly closes the overcoat.
174,"BMO says Exiting Okay, wish me luck, fellas, even though I don't need-"
175,"Ice King falls down the ladder, interrupting BMO. They both scream as they fall. There is a thud. Finn and Jake giggle at their shenanigans."
176,Finn and Jake says Together Aww.
177,BMO and Ice King leave the Tree House.
178,"Ice King says Boy, this is great, huh? You and me out in the fresh air? Now, the key to being a tip-top salesman is to get the ol' foot in the door."
179,"BMO says Bodies don't talk, Ice King."
180,"Ice King says Well, mine does."
181,"BMO says Okay, then. If I say ""My feet hurt,"" you can go ""Woof woof."" That's my dogs barking."
182,"Ice King says BMO, I think we're gonna make an unbeatable team."
183,"BMO says Yeah, yeah! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Kicking the sides of Ice King's head and laughing."
184,"A sword logo flies onto screen reading ""Potential customer time!"" The scene changes to Tree Trunks' house."
185,"Tree Trunks says Reading as she types on a typewriter ""Chapter 3 says No Time For Sleeping. Elizabeth's heart was racing like a water mill after spring thaw. She knew her enemies were coming for her, but when? Suddenly, there was a knock at the door."""
186,"Suddenly, there is a knock at the door."
187,"Tree Trunks says Oh! Oh. Oh, my goodness. Someone's at the door. That's all. She opens the door, finding BMO and Ice King. Hello."
188,"BMO says Tree Trunks, how are your children? Can you believe this weather? After some fumbling, Ice King tips BMO's hat politely."
189,"Tree Trunks says So polite. Please, please come in."
190,BMO says Taking a seat You have a lovely home.
191,"Tree Trunks says Here, have some apple pie."
192,"BMO says Oh, thank you."
193,Ice King snatches the apple pie and takes it inside the overcoat.
194,Tree Trunks says Now what can I do for you?
195,"BMO says Oh, well, I'd like to show you what I'm selling today."
196,"He grunts and kicks Ice King, who is busy eating the pie inside the coat. Ice King puts his arms back into the sleeves and rummages through his and BMO's bag."
197,"BMO says Okay, we have a broken branch, a half-eaten sandwich - oh, another ball of lint."
198,Tree Trunks says Another?
199,"BMO says These are selling like red hots. A dust bunny - That's like a cage-free ball of lint. A doll's head, and a little velvet bag, tied tight at the top."
200,"While BMO is presenting the items, Ice King struggles to eat more of the apple pie with his tongue."
201,Tree Trunks says I'll take the branch. My loose cash is up there in the flower jar. Help yourself.
202,"Ice King makes his way to the shelf with the jar, stubbing his toe and smashing several plates on the way. He reaches into the jar and pulls out a huge roll of banknotes."
203,"BMO says Laughs happily as Ice King tosses the money wad from hand to hand. Tree Trunks joins the laughter, not really paying attention as she has been distracted by the branch. You have a lovely home! Ice King falls out the door and they both scream as they exit."
204,"Mr. Pig says Entering What'd you buy, honey bunch?"
205,Tree Trunks says A branch.
206,"Mr. Pig says Huh. Tree Trunks turns him around and starts scratching his back with the branch. Huh? Oh. Ah, Tree Trunks, you're a financial genius."
207,"BMO says Laughing as he and Ice King leave the orchard. I can't believe we unloaded that branch. It wasn't even our best one. Oh, my. Shield my eyes from the sun."
208,Ice King says Why?
209,"BMO says Because I think I see our next customer. They watch a large chipmunk carrying a couple of acorns. Those nuts could be ours. Excuse me, little boy!"
210,"The chipmunk begins running, and Ice King begins chasing."
211,"BMO says How are your children?! Ice King, duck. Jump. Right. Right again. Laughs Left. Jump, jump. Left. Right. Left. Ice King, you're doing so good. You have not bumped into anything."
212,They come to a stop.
213,"Ice King says BMO, where's the customer?"
214,"BMO says Oh, no. I was so excited about you not bumping into anything, I lost the customer. Ice King, I think we are lost."
215,An animal howls. The scene fades to later. BMO and Ice King have arrived at a ziggurat.
216,BMO says Look. A house.
217,Ice King says All I see is the inside of this coat.
218,They approach a door.
219,BMO says And... stop. Knock politely.
220,"Ice King knocks, and footsteps are heard inside. A mysterious figure answers the door and beckons them inside."
221,"BMO says Mysterious sentinel, you have a lovely home. Whispering to Ice King Turn. Continues talking to the mysterious figure How are your children? BMO gasps, noticing that the figure has disappeared."
222,"Ice King wanders further into the zigurrat, where he finds Uncle Gumbald mixing liquids in a pair of test tubes."
223,BMO says Hello.
224,One of the tubes produces a skull-shaped puff of smoke which floats towards BMO and Ice King. Gumbald retrieves an axe from beneath his desk.
225,"BMO says I'm a door-to-door salesman, ma'am."
226,The smoke enters the coat and Ice King is heard choking.
227,"BMO says Chuckling Oh, excuse my indigestion. He kicks Ice King."
228,Ice King says Ouch.
229,"BMO says I have some wonderful new products, like, uh, this ball of lint. No, wait, this is the dust bunny. Uh... Oh, oh! I know - this velvet bag."
230,Gumbald raises the axe menacingly.
231,BMO says Did I mention that it contains Finn's teeth?
232,Gumbald drops the axe to the ground and suddenly adopts a polite manner.
233,"Gumbald says Please, let's go in the parlor, where we can be more comfortable."
234,"The scene changes. BMO, Ice King, and Gumbald are sat in the parlor while Gumbald examines the teeth."
235,Gumbald says And you're sure these are Finn's teeth?
236,BMO says Yes.
237,"Gumbald says The same Finn who serves Princess Bubblegum, obstructs my plans, and plagues my thoughts?"
238,BMO says Yes.
239,Gumbald says Finn the Human's teeth?
240,BMO says That's a BMO guarantee.
241,Ice King says Whispering Psst! Does Finn know you have his teeth? Because I don't think-
242,BMO says Interrupting Hey! I'm trying to close a sale here.
243,"Gumbald says I hope you accept silver. I can pay you immediately. Admiring the teeth Yes, my pretties."
244,The scene changes back to the Tree House. It is night.
245,Jake says Poor little guy. Still wearing out the shoe leather trying to make just one more lousy sale before coming home.
246,Finn says He'll feel better after we have a little party for him.
247,"Finn and Jake have prepared an ""employee of the month"" poster for BMO, and set out some cupcakes on the table."
248,"Jake says Still, it's tough seeing your kid get his heart set on doing something he really sucks at."
249,The door is heard. BMO and Ice King enter.
250,"BMO says Hello, boys. Meet the salesman of the year. Or maybe of the decade. The Chinese food is on me. I mean, check out the loot. Ice King hands Finn a silver goblet."
251,Finn says Whispering to Jake It's real.
252,Jake says What the heck did you sell to get this silver goblet?
253,"BMO says Just a line of smooth talk and pipe dreams. Oh, and a set of human baby teeth."
254,Finn says Where did you even get a set of human baby teeth? Suddenly realizing Human baby teeth!! He rushes up to the bedroom and retrieves a box from a drawer. It's empty. BMO!
255,"BMO says Branches and lint are moving like cray, Jake."
256,Finn shows BMO the empty box accusatively.
257,"BMO says Oh, sure, I sold your baby teeth. I could sell any part of you."
258,"Finn says These were, like, the only things I had left from when I was a little kid."
259,"Jake says Hey, you know what? We'll just go buy back those little pearly whites. I'm sure whoever bought them is like, ""Why did I buy these things?"" What possible use could some guy have for a set of human baby teeth? Unless he's an evil sorcerer or a mad scientist... He wasn't a mad scientist, was he?"
260,BMO says Well...
261,There is a pounding on the door. A load of Baby Teeth Finns break down the door and enter the Tree Fort.
262,"Finn says High pitch shriek Stay back, baby Finns. Babies begin climbing him, and he and Jake both scream."
263,BMO says Groans nervously
264,A baby starts gnawing on Finn's arm. He punts it with his fist and it shatters a window as it flies through.
265,"Finn says They're made out of some kind of hard tooth-like material. Ouch. Ouch! Ice King, freeze these nightmare babies."
266,Ice King says I'm not allowed to wear my crown. It's against BMO's dress code.
267,Jake says Just don't let them climb into your mouth!
268,A baby tries to enter Finn's mouth.
269,"Jake says Hey, there, bitey boys. Get off of there. More babies attack Jake. Where's your baby manners? Eek."
270,BMO says Hmm. Maybe I sold too well.
271,"Ice King says Hey, you're a great salesman. Evil babies are not a problem for you. They're an opportunity."
272,"BMO says Yeah. Where did I put those - Oh, here they are. Ice King pulls out a couple of sledgehammers. Gentlemen, could I interest you in a couple of sledgehammers? Perfect for smashing through minerals or composites."
273,Finn says Being gnawed by babies I'll take one.
274,Jake says Me too!
275,BMO says Great decision.
276,Ice King hands the hammers to Finn and Jake. Finn taps one of the babies and it disintegrates with a poof. He smashes a few more babies.
277,BMO says A little tap is all it takes.
278,Jake says Smashing babies These baby-smashing hammers are great.
279,"They continue smashing all the babies. Gumbald is seen outside, watching through a telescope. After all the babies are smashed, Finn, Jake, and BMO begin sweeping up the mess."
280,BMO says I'm sorry I caused such a mess. It's very bad for business.
281,"Ice King says Well, time to call it a day. He pulls out a clocking-in machine and a punchcard, and clocks out, then places a small hat atop his crown. The ice man leaveth."
282,"BMO says Hey, wait. See you tomorrow, partner. They shake hands."
283,Ice King says Until tomorrow.
284,"Finn says Yeah, you're not doing this tomorrow."
285,"Ice King exits, whistling. Gumbald watches through his telescope."
286,"Gumbald says Hmm. In retrospect, the attack would have worked much better were they not baby teeth. Clears throat."
287,"The episode opens in the evening at a party on the beach. Flags read ""CLAM RAP""."
288,Neptr says Begins rapping Clams and Raps♪ C-C-C-C-Clam Rap ♪♪ Juicy like nectar ♪♪ My name is Neptr ♪♪ I stay rapping no matter what the weather ♪♪ I'm by the fire 'cause it's hot like a dryer... ♪
289,"Finn gets a plate of clams from Crab Princess and goes over to Flame Princess, who is by the bonfire. Neptr continues rapping in the background."
290,"Finn says Clams and rappin'. Doesn't get any better than this, right, Phoebe?"
291,Flame Princess says It's actually my first Clam Rap.
292,"Finn says Begins beatboxing and then continues the Clams and Raps song♪ Clams, clams ♪♪ Ate this plate of clams ♪♪ Utensils weren't provided ♪♪ So I had to use my hands ♪♪ I'm gonna be unhappy ♪♪ If it happens agains ♪Boom!"
293,The other partygoers cheer for Finn.

300,"""Victor Marilyn"" says Hello there, young lady. I heard you lay down some serious rhymes earlier. Eats a clam and hands Flame Princess a business card. My card."
301,Flame Princess says Reading Victor Marilyn? The card burns up in her hands.

303,Flame Princess says Whoa. I've never heard of Rap Fest Aid.
304,Finn says It sure sounds like the big time.
305,"""Victor Marilyn"" says But before I can book you anywhere, I'm gonna have to have you sign some waivers and release forms. Boilerplate stuff. Don't bother reading it."
306,Flame Princess says Cheerfully Okay. She signs the papers.
307,"""Victor Marilyn"" says Chuckling Okay! I'll get this paperwork processed, and we'll be in business. ""Victor's"" mustache suddenly pops off, revealing that it was Toronto all along."
308,Finn says Toronto!
309,"Toronto says Laughs Yes, it's me! And I'm making my move from second banana to top dog. As stated in the contract that you just signed, if you lose Rap Fest Aid, the Fire Kingdom becomes my property."
310,Flame Princess says Flaring up What?!
311,"Finn says Aw, don't worry. Look at this mug. You could out-rap him any day of the week."
312,"Toronto says Oh, you won't be facing me. You'll have to beat the most gifted rapper of our time. Son of Rap Bear! See you in a week. He exits, waved off by Neptr."
313,Finn and Flame Princess says Together Son of Rap Bear?

315,The scene changes to daytime. Finn and Flame Princess approach the Monster where the Party Bears live. It is asleep.

319,Finn says Knock knock.
320,Rap Bear says Looking up Who's there?
321,Finn says Concerned Rap Bear. What happened?
322,Rap Bear says Groans My son and I were having Sunday dinner. We were lightly rapping back and forth. It turned into a rap battle. He threw out rhyme after rhyme. I couldn't keep up.
323,Finn says You got beat by your own son? Are his rap powers that much greater than yours?
324,Rap Bear says Yes. Why are you asking about my son?
325,Finn says Flame Princess is going up against him one on one in a freestyle battle.
326,"Rap Bear says Gasps That kid will take you apart. Rap Bear wheels himself out from under the table, revealing that he is in a wheelchair and both his legs are missing. He rapped my legs off."
327,Finn and Flame Princess look shocked. The scene changes to the Candy Kingdom in the evening. Finn and Flame Princess approach the Candy Tavern.
328,"Finn says Rap Bear, Son of Rap Bear's father, said his son, Son of Rap Bear, would be at tonight's open mic."
329,They enter. A small audience is watching Son of Rap Bear and a gingerbread man engaging in a rap battle.
330,"Flame Princess says Dude, let's sit back here."
331,"Gingerbread Rapper says Rapping♪ You're a small bear with fuzzy hair over there ♪♪ Get away from me, I don't wanna share my air ♪♪ Doesn't matter where, anywhere, everywhere with you ♪♪ Chop you in two with my rap kung fu ♪♪ Are you scared of me? Boo! ♪"

333,The gingerbread man's head is blown off by a rap-induced explosion. The audience cheers for Son of Rap Bear.
334,Finn and Flame Princess says Together Whoa.
335,Son of Rap Bear spots Flame Princess.
336,"Son of Rap Bear says Look who decided to come out to play. The news on street says you're gonna battle me at Rap Fest Aid. Rapping♪ This is a joke, right?

337,Parts of the tavern explode during the rap. Finn and Flame Princess retreat and exit. The scene changes to the two of them walking at night.
338,Flame Princess says Son of Rap Bear is right. I just rap about rapping. I haven't traveled the world or done anything really. Finn! Let's go on some adventures!
339,Finn says What?
340,Flame Princess says It would really help me build up some quick life experience.
341,Finn says I don't know if life is like a test you can cram for.
342,Flame Princess says This is for my kingdom. I've got to try.

345,"Finn, Jake, BMO, and Neptr are listening to Flame Princess' rap in the Tree House."
346,Finn says That was good!
347,"Flame Princess says I thought trying new things would make me new and interesting, but I just feel like a hack."
348,"BMO says Maybe there is an interesting thing about you that you just don't realize. Like how Neptr only just found out there is a face on his can, and now he thinks the can is his conjoined twin."
349,Neptr says I don't expect you to understand the bond I share with my family.
350,Flame Princess says Family...
351,"The scene changes. Flame King is sat in his cave, drawing pictures on rocks. He hums cheerfully as he draws a picture of an animal face."
352,Flame King says No room for the body. Let's make him swim.
353,Flame Princess says Knock knock.
354,"Flame King says Is that you, Bun Bun? Aah!"
355,Flame Princess says Hi Dad.
356,"Flame King says You're not here to put me back in lantern jail, are you?"
357,Flame Princess says I guess I wanted to talk.
358,Flame King says Oh.
359,"Flame Princess says It seems like lot's changed since I last saw you. Maybe we actually have a shot at putting the past behind us and, I don't know, being normal with each other."
360,"Flame King says I know exactly what you're saying. I've totally gotten over being in lantern jail, so we're good."
361,"Flame Princess says Well, I was kind of hoping you could acknowledge hurting me, like-"
362,"Flame King says Phoebes, come on. It's better to be thankful for what you have now; an awesome chipmunk dad! ... Uh, I'm gonna put on some music. You're totally welcome to listen, or not. Totally up to you."
363,Flame Princess says So you won't even apologize?
364,Flame King drops an acorn into a nearby tissue box. Three chipmunks appear and one of them begins to rap the Chipmunks Rap. Flame Princess exits angrily.
365,Flame King says Ugh. Drama.
366,"The scene changes to the Wizard Battle Arena, where a crowd has gathered to watch the rap battle."

386,"Flame Princess says Raging Dad! She calms down Why the heck did I ever try to talk to you? You only ever cared about things like koalas, and chipmunks, and baby kangaroos. She begins to rap♪ It's actually pretty sad, I mean ♪♪ I usurped you when I was fourteen ♪♪ I thought we could be friends, I don't know what I was thinking ♪♪ I don't need you or anyone 'cause I'm the real Flame King ♪"

393,The audience ignores him and tramples the two of them to go and lift Flame Princess.
394,"Son of Rap Bear says Rapping sadly♪ I thought I was the Glob of rap, rivaled by none ♪♪ But I'm more like bubble wrap 'cause she squashed me for fun ♪His legs pop off from the self-own."

596,"Randy says That... Tree Trunks, that's not why I asked you here."

599,Tree Trunks says Oh.
600,"Randy says I'm going to propose to my girlfriend this weekend. I've got the chocolates, and the flowers, but I need that ring."
601,"Tree Trunks says Well, I'm sorry, but I threw that ring down a bottomless pit."
602,Randy says Oh no!
603,"Tree Trunks says No, wait, that's not right. I used that ring to propose to my second husband, Danny."

613,"Crew member says Captain Tree Trunks, we're approaching a ship off the port bow!"
614,Tree Trunks says Good. She goes to look. Drown all but the tightest men.
615,Danny says Shouting up from a small sailboat No!
616,Tree Trunks says Impudence.
617,"Danny says I beg of you, madam, while I am tight, my brother is not, and yet I love him."
618,Tree Trunks says Hmm.
619,"Danny says My name is Daniel Prince and this is my brother, Peanut. Please look into your heart and pity him, for though our family is quite wealthy, he has had a difficult life. Subtly loosening his shirt You are a very beautiful elephant, but I fear your bandit ways have made you hard."
620,Tree Trunks says Narrating He was right. I left my post that very day so that I could spend the rest of my life with Danny.
621,"Tree Trunks is seen throwing her cutlass at Mr. Faidutti's feet and departing La Femme Du La Mer in Danny's sailboat. She and Danny make out enthusiastically while ""Peanut"" sits beside them. The scene changes to a small island, where Tree Trunks places the ring on Danny's front foot."

629,Crew members says Ah! Scuttling up a tree Woop woop woop woop woop.
630,Tree Trunks says Narrating A liar in cahoots with Mr. Faidutti to get me away from my ship.

638,Tree Trunks says I savvily invested my pirate treasure and became a powerful shipping magnate.
639,"Another flashback begins. Tree Trunks is sat in a luxurious office, overlooking the ocean as cargo ships come and go. There is a knock on the door. Tree Trunks puts in a glass eye and turns to face the door."
640,Tree Trunks says Come in.
641,Wyatt enters with a bouquet of roses.
642,"Wyatt says Uh, I'm Wyatt, your new secretary. These flowers are from ""Robot Body Moe""."
643,"Tree Trunks says Oh, again? Throw those in the trash."
644,"Wyatt says Okay, ma'am. He approaches the trashcan and begins trying to stuff the flowers in head-first. They're a little - a little big. Oh, boy."
645,"Tree Trunks says The other way, like a vase."
646,"Wyatt groans and begins crying, unable to figure out how to get the flowers into the trashcan. He gives up and curls into a ball on the floor, sobbing. Tree Trunks watches him, displaying no emotion."
647,Tree Trunks says Narrating He melted my heart.
648,Flash forward to yet another wedding. Wyatt and Tree Trunks exchange rings.
649,Wyatt says Hey-hey!

656,Tree Trunks says Laughs I'm never wearing clothes again! She runs into the waves.
657,"Wyatt says I, uh, might keep my shirt on."
658,"Tree Trunks says Narrating I thought Glob had told me, ""Here's someone who needs your love."" But what he really must've said was, ""Go suck an egg, Tree Trunks."""
659,Flash forward. Tree Trunks and Wyatt are in Tree Trunks' current house in the apple orchard. Wyatt reaches for a slice of apple pie but Tree Trunks pulls it away.
660,Tree Trunks says No more pie.
661,Wyatt says But that's my pie.
662,Tree Trunks says You're draining my life away.
663,Wyatt says Yelling anxiously Take care of me!
664,Tree Trunks says No. You've emptied me of my joie de vivre.
665,"Wyatt says Whinging, hitting himself, crying I've got the ring! If I don't give it back, it means we're still in love! He exits the house. I'm throwing it in a bottomless pit!"
666,"Flashback ends. Once more, the scene is back in the diner."
667,Randy says Wyatt threw my ring in a pit?
668,"Tree Trunks says Yeah, sorry about that. Uh- huh?"
669,"A ceiling tile gives way and Mr. Pig comes crashing down onto the table with a scream. He hits his head and falls to the floor, groaning."
670,"Tree Trunks says Mr. Pig, what are you doing here?"
671,Mr. Pig says I followed you because I was afraid that - And now I see you-
672,"Tree Trunks says Oh, no."
673,Randy says I just wanted my grandma's ring back.
674,Tree Trunks says And I just didn't want you to worry over nothing.
675,"Mr. Pig says R-Really? Oh, geez."
676,"Wyatt says There you are! He emerges from a vent. How could you, Tree Trunks?"
677,Tree Trunks says Wyatt? You've been following me?
678,"Wyatt says You wish, babe. I've been following him points at Randy to you! But if Tree Trunks is gonna be stepping out on her man with one of her exes, it's gonna be me! He tries to tackle Randy but slips on a piece of ceiling tile and falls to the ground, groaning. Tree Trunks, help me. I need you."
679,Randy says Spots the ring hanging on a string around Wyatt's neck. My ring! Just give me...
680,Randy pulls the ring out of Wyatt's grasp.
681,Wyatt says My suck-suck ring.
682,"Randy says Aha! Gotcha! He exits, laughing gleefully."
683,"Mr. Pig says Um, I'm sorry I didn't trust you. I just know you've had a lot of adventures in the past and things are kind of boring now."
684,"Tree Trunks says It's true. I sometimes miss those wild times, but back then, I couldn't even tell the difference between a good adventure and a bad one. I was just a leaf in the wind, blown about by my whims. But now I'm on solid ground. You and Sweet P are my - uh-"
685,Mr. Pig says Your greatest adventure?
686,Tree Trunks says Yeah.
687,Danny enters.
688,"Danny says Whoa, what the..? Is that Wyatt? Tree Trunks?"

739,"Hunson says I'm in town for the week, and I don't really have a place to stay, dot, dot, dot."
740,Marceline says Mnh. How many souls did he suck on his way here?
741,"Finn says Oh, I guess like zero. But-"

851,Finn says Poor guy.
852,"Kim Kil Whan says Something terrifying has taken residence in Joshua and Margaret's old office, and it's not paying rent. So I want you guys to find out what it is and get it out."
853,"Jake says Yes, sir, son!"
854,"Kim Kil Whan says You have one hour! Bye, dad. He teleports out."
855,Jake says I wonder what it could be.
856,"Finn says Maybe it's a gross rotting fish gob with long, slimy tentacles."
857,Jake says Maybe it's a teenage silverware werewolf squatter.
858,"Finn says Hey, you know what it could be? It could be a ghost. I think I saw a ghost there when I was a baby. Maybe it's like a ghost hotspot."
859,"Jake says Ghosts, huh? Whoa, wait! What if it's..."
860,Finn and Jake says Together Ghost Mom and Dad!
861,Finn says I have to brush my hair!
862,Jake says I'll go get tulips for Mom!
863,"The scene changes. Finn and Jake approach the old office. Finn is wearing a tie over his regular clothes, and Jake has some flowers."
864,"Jake says Man, I've never been this excited about ghosts before."
865,Finn says This could be one more chance to tell Mom and Dad how much we love them.
866,Jake says And show 'em that their kids are awesome.
867,"They high five, then enter."
868,"Jake says Hello? Ghosts? If you're in here, please vacate my son's property!"
869,Finn says Unless you're Mom and Dad ghosts!
870,"Jake says Yeah, in that case, I brought flowers!"
871,Finn says Look. There's the broken window. But I don't see any signs of squatters... or ghosts.
872,Jake says Pots the flowers I'll sniff 'em out. Sniffing
873,"Finn says Hey Jake, why don't we own this place?"
874,Jake says I dunno. Kim Kil Whan is a good businessman. Plus I'd feel kinda weird dealing with this stuff.
875,"Finn says Yeah. Just looking at all this is like, ""Whoa, memories!"" Like this ticker tape machine. Remember when Mom and Dad brought us to work and we made a fort of ticker tape?"
876,Jake says It was right over there! And over here you gave me a wet willie one time.
877,Finn says Ew. No I didn't.
878,"Jake says Right. I know you believe that's true, but memories distort over time. Classic false memory syndrome."
879,Finn says Maybe you're the one with a false memory syndrome.
880,Jake says Classic false memory syndrome response.
881,They hear a ticking sound.
882,Finn says You hear that? Can you use your dog powers to locate that sound?
883,"Jake says With enlarged ears Way ahead of you, pal. Uh... over there! He runs over to the bathroom and barges in. Aha! There's nothing there, and the ticking has stopped."
884,Finn says Anything?
885,"Jake says Nope. This is a nice bathroom, though. Man, this whole office is nice. It's kinda bunk how Mom and Dad stopped using it."
886,"Finn says Yeah, it's weird that they had this whole other life, and they just dropped it for us babies."
887,Jake says We were babies forever.
888,"Finn says Man, we suck."
889,"Jake says Exiting the bathroom Yeah, but they knew what they were getting into. Whoa! Who moved the sofa? Who put forth those chairs?! Who set the table?! What's going on?!"
890,Finn says This griz is poltergeist biz.
891,Jake says But I don't want that.
892,"Finn says Embrace the paranormal, bro. Examining the candles on the dining table Are these candles real or poltergeist mind-tricks?"
893,Jake says Look!
894,A video tape on the bookshelf rattles and falls to the ground.
895,Finn and Jake says Together Poltergeist!
896,"The scene changes. Finn and Jake have found a video player and are watching the tape. The video begins, revealing Joshua. Behind the camera is Margaret."
897,"Margaret says Ooh, goody. It's on now, dear."
898,"Joshua says Well done, Margaret, love."
899,Finn and Jake says Together Dad!
900,"Joshua says Hello, future people. I'm Joshua of Joshua and Margaret Investigations, and behind the camera you have my lovely wife and partner, Margaret."
901,Margaret says Hello.
902,"Joshua says We're making this tape to document the strange phenomena in our new office. Like this weird message spelled out in- Joshua accidentally tramples the message. Oh, applesauce."
903,"Margaret says You've really stepped in it now, darling."
904,"Joshua says Indubitably. But something is definitely trying to chat us up, and we're gonna catch it on film. I got this fancy ghost-hunting doohickey. It's supposed to record EVPs and such. The ticking is heard, and Joshua gasps. A ghostly silhouette appears behind him."
905,"Margaret says Gracious, there it is!"
906,Joshua says Margaret! Margaret! There's another one over here!
907,Another ghost charges out of the bathroom and throws a chair into the camera. Margaret screams and the video cuts out.
908,Finn says Dude! This place is full of ghosts! We should split up and see if we can get them to appear.
909,Jake says I'll take the bathroom!
910,"Finn says That's the spirit. Hmm. ""Spirit."""
911,The sun sets and the scene turns to night.
912,"Finn says Maybe Mom and Dad left some books about ghost hunting. Hmm. He examines some of the books on the shelf, then hears the ticking again. A ghost appears from around the corner."
913,"Finn says Gasps A ghost! The ghost fades away. It seems like the ticking precedes each ghost encounter. Okay, Finn, what ticks? Metronomes, bombs, pencils..."
914,"Cut to the bathroom, where Jake is cowering in fear, his teeth chattering."
915,Jake says The bathroom is a lot scarier than I was expecting.
916,"The ticking is heard, and then a ghost barges into the bathroom in the same manner that Jake did earlier. Jake screams, then the scene cuts back to Finn."
917,"Finn says ...hearts, egg timers, typewriters."
918,"Jake runs through the room and throws the chairs out of his way, just like the ghost on the tape."
919,"Finn says What else? The ticking is heard, and three small ghosts appear next to Finn. Whoa, lil' ghost babies! Wait, that's baby Jermaine! And baby Jake! And baby me!"
920,Baby Jake says Babababa!
921,Baby Jake hits Baby Finn playfully and giggles.
922,Finn says Chuckles Oh yeah?
923,Current Finn gives Baby Jake a wet willie.
924,Baby Jake says Oh! Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip!
925,"Finn says Laughs Oh, snap. I guess it was me. Hold on. These babies ain't ghoulish ghosts at all. They're like time... disto...to...morphs? Hmm."
926,"The scene changes. Jake emerges from the kitchen, with a makeshift suit of armor made of frying pans."
927,"Jake says Scared? No way! I'm primitive! I'm real! Ghosts, you can't touch this dog! You've got ethereal hands! I'm alive! I'm filled with hot blood! You'll never see through me! He bursts into the bathroom again. Gotcha, ghoul!"
928,"Instead of the same bathroom as before, the room is instead furnished with futuristic decor. A mole man is sat on a sci-fi toilet reading a newspaper."
929,Mole Man says Pardon?
930,"Jake says Aah! Oh, sorry for interrupting your poop. Jake exits, takes a second to process what he just saw, and then re-enters with his eyes covered. Hey, sorry again, man, but I have a qu- Gasps"
931,"The design of the room has changed again, this time to contain fancy nineteenth century decor. A human woman in a dress is powdering her face."
932,Woman says Screams
933,"Jake says Screams and exits again. I gotta get out of here! No, Jake. You gotta stay for your boy Kim Kil Whan. Ghost! Quit freeloading off my son! Barging into the bathroom one more time. That's a father's job. The bathroom is back to normal, but Jake hears Joshua's voice from the window."
934,"Joshua says Strained Margaret, stay away!"
935,Jake says Huh? He looks out the window.
936,Joshua says Something's about to happen!
937,Jake says Dad?
938,The scene cuts back to Finn and the babies.
939,"Finn says So, I can see you, and you can see me. And we're occupying the same space now. So this time stuff must be getting more intense. The shape-shifter appears at the window. Whoa!"
940,"Baby Jake says Straining Farts loudly, his diaper sagging downward Sighs with relief"
941,"Finn says Sniffs the air Holds Baby Jake away Aw, dude! You couldn't wait until you were back in your own time?"
942,The shape-shifter stares inside at Baby Jake and exhales on the glass.
943,"Finn says Hey, creeper, stop creepin' on baby Jake! The shape-shifter exits, and the babies disappear. Baby Jake?"
944,"Jake says Enters Finn! I'm freaking out, man! I just saw the most messed-up thing!"
945,"A flashback begins. Jake is at the window, looking out at his parents in the alleyway. It is a repeat of Jake's birth, as previously seen in ""Joshua and Margaret Investigations""."
946,Jake says Dad?
947,"Joshua says Margaret, stay away! Something's about to happen!"
948,"Margaret says Something's about to happen with me, too!"
949,Joshua says Margaret! Aah! His head swells and pops. Yowzas!
950,"Baby Jake says Singing Hello, Daddy! Hello, Mommy! It's so nice to be here with you now!"
951,The flashback ends.
952,Jake says That's so not how I was birthed! I'm no melon baby! I'm a majestic womb baby!
953,"Finn says Jake, calm down."
954,Jake says I'm gonna go hog-wild on the next ghost I see!
955,The scene of Rennie Hamlin approaching the office is seen again. He enters through the front door.
956,"Rennie says Boy, do I love real estate!"
957,"A ticking begins, and Jake from the future appears as a ghost to Rennie, who is a ghost himself from Jake's perspective. Jake gasps and shape-shifts into a screaming tentacle monster. Rennie screams and becomes petrified, as seen earlier."
958,Jake says Aah! He exits.
959,Rennie leaves through the front door again. His phone rings.
960,Kim Kil Whan says Over the phone Rennie?
961,Rennie says Stammering incoherently.
962,The scene cuts back to Finn and Jake in the present.
963,Jake says We're trapped in a ghost trap!
964,"Finn says Relax, bro. There's no ghosts. What we're experiencing are time slips. Point is, something is causing this."
965,There is a ticking and a shattering sound as an unknown time ghost breaks the window and enters the house. It climbs into the attic.
966,Finn says You ready?
967,"Jake looks uneasy, and holds Finn's hand. They follow the time ghost into the attic. They see three ghosts there, and there is a constant ticking."
968,"Finn says Time dingalings! Wait, that ticking. I know who this is! He and Jake walk over to the ghosts, where they take the place of two of them; their future selves. The third ghost resolves, and is revealed to be Clock Bear. Clock Bear!"
969,Jake says One of the dudes that escaped Dr. Gross' menagerie.
970,"Finn says He must be the one causing the time slips. There's us from before. He points to the attic's entrance hatch, where their past selves are climbing up."
971,Clock Bear says Groans
972,Finn says Are you sick?
973,"Jake says Yeah, I'm pretty disgusted with the whole situation!"
974,Finn says I meant Clock Bear.
975,"Clock Bear groans again and falls onto his stomach. His winding key stops moving. The ticking stops. Finn hesitates, and then begins winding him up again. All of the time ghosts in the house begin to be sucked back into Clock Bear's mechanisms. There is a sound of rushing wind and the constant ticking of clockwork."
976,Finn says Shouting over the noise He's sucking up all the spilled time!
977,Jake says That doesn't sound scientific!
978,"Finn says Gasps Jake, take care of Clock Bear. There's something I gotta do!"
979,"Jake says Wait, I'm still confused! And having feelings!"
980,"Finn rushes downstairs to the ticker tape machine. He takes a length of tape and begins arranging it on the floor. The scene changes to show Joshua and Margaret in the same room, in the past. Margaret has lain the table and is putting forth the chairs. Joshua spots the tape arranging itself."
981,"Joshua says Oh boy, our first case! Looks like we have a poltergeist! The tape spells out ""I love u"". And it's got a little crush on me. What a sassafrass! Gotta get this one tape! As he reaches for the tape on the bookshelf, he causes it to rattle and fall to the ground. Whoops!"
982,"The scene changes back to the present once more. Jake, alone, enters the alleyway where he saw himself being born moments ago."
983,"Jake says If this was all time weirdness, I guess that memory was true. I did see my own birth. Far out. Jake suddenly notices that the shape-shifter is standing right next to him. Oh! Must be a leftover time ghost. The shape-shifter touches Jake's shoulder and he turns blue. Hmm."
984,Shape-shifter says We have to leave!
985,Jake says We're doin' what now?
986,"The scene changes. Finn is stood at the front of the house with Clock Bear, talking on the phone."
987,"Finn says It was just Clock Bear... No, I don't think he has any money. Finn hears something happening in the alleyway and hangs up. Jake? Jake! He enters the alleyway. Oh, no! Something's happened to Jake! He could be in grave dang- He spots a note on the ground. It reads ""BRB -Jake"". ...Okay, then."
988,The episode opens in the Tree Fort's treasure room. Finn is reading the note Jake left at the end of the last episode.
989,"Finn says ""B.R.B. - Jake"". Hmm. B.R.B... B.R.B. Bring regular babies. Big red balls. No. Beautiful rump burger."
990,"BMO enters down the ladder into the treasure room, carrying a banana."
991,"BMO says What you doing, Finn?"
992,"Finn says Jake left me this note, but I, uh tuts I can't remem what the abbreve means."
993,BMO says Gasps It's for me! This is Jake's special code to tell me he loves me.
994,"Finn says No, it's something normal like, uh..."
995,BMO says Be right back. He walks away.
996,"Finn says Right! ""Be right back!"" Laughs So dumb. Cool. Jake'll be right back."
997,"There is a thud, and Finn looks over to BMO. BMO has produced a box of papers from a bookshelf in a nearby treasure pile."
998,"BMO says Look, Finn! My Jake Valentines. He leaves them for me when he goes out."
999,The box contains various notes from Jake.
1000,"Finn says That's cute, BMO."
1001,"BMO says Yeah, I know."
1002,Finn spots an issue of Ble magazine that fell on BMO's head while he was retrieving the box.
1003,"Finn says Oh, Ble. I love Ble! Taking the magazine I'll read some Ble 'til Jake gets back, I guess."
1004,BMO laughs and giggles at one of the notes. Finn sits on a massage chair and begins reading the magazine. He chuckles as he turns the pages.
1005,"Finn says Reading out loud ""What's your favorite food?"" ""Anything! As long as it's made of cheese!"" Laughs Aw, man, these comics are like if someone put my soul on a page. Turns the page where there is an illustration of a saber-toothed cat biting a caveman while a doctor writes on a clipboard. Hmm? ""You write the caption."" Okay! Hmm. Thinks of something and laughs to himself, taking a pen from his backpack to begin writing. ""Ouch! Hey, this isn't helping."" Chuckles Yeah. Calling out Ja - I mean, BMO!"
1006,"BMO is sat on the floor, pretending to make the banana and one of Jake's notes kiss each other."
1007,Finn says Check this funny caption I just wrote.
1008,"BMO says Hmm. He begins beeping and his faceplate reads ""scanning humor"", then turns into an exclamation point. No humor detected."
1009,"Finn says What? No, it's - it's like... this guy's problem is a tiger biting his foot, and talking to this guy isn't helping! Like, ""Ouch! Hey, this isn't helping!"" You know, like, it's, you know, like..."
1010,BMO says Was the tiger already biting his foot? Or did the tiger bite his foot after he lay down on the couch? Because that is the bearded man's responsibility.
1011,"Finn says BMO, I love you, but you don't understand comedy."
1012,BMO says Maybe it's just not funny.
1013,"Finn says Gasps This is funny, and I'm gonna prove it!"
1014,BMO says You are?
1015,"Finn says Yeah, I mean, I'm pretty bored, and this is really funny, BMO."
1016,BMO says Shouting Prove it!
1017,Finn says Angrily Fine! I'm going to!
1018,BMO says Fine! Squashes the banana. I'll be right here!
1019,Finn says Fine!
1020,BMO says Fine!
1021,"Finn slams the door, then smiles and waves at BMO through the window. BMO smirks and waves back. They were both just pretending to be angry. The scene changes to the Candy Kingdom, where Princess Bubblegum is riding through the streets on a hoverboard wearing a siren hat and carrying a laser gun and a megaphone."
1022,"Princess Bubblegum says Bwee-woo-bwee-woo! This is a drill! She shoots a house with her laser gun and the wall explodes. I repeat, this is a drill! She shoots another house."
1023,Candy people says Oh no! A real drill?!
1024,"Princess Bubblegum says You two, raise your resinous glaze shields! She shoots at the two candy people and the house behind them explodes. Several seconds too late, they lift up a pane of shielding that was supposed to defend against the shot."
1025,"Candy people says Oh, oh, oh, oh!"
1026,Princess Bubblegum says Activate the B.H.T. to preserve freshness!
1027,A Gumball Guardian pulls a lever and a green force field descends across the whole kingdom. Bubblegum looks at her watch.
1028,Princess Bubblegum says We're not ready.
1029,"Candy people says Intruder! Intruder! It's our friend, Finn!"
1030,"Finn enters, escorted by two candy people holding his hands."
1031,"Finn says What's all the hubbub, Bubs?"
1032,"Princess Bubblegum says Oh, just some precautionary exercises in case our primary alarm and defense system fails."
1033,"Finn says Cool. Cool. Hey, can you look at this funny thing I wrote?"
1034,"Princess Bubblegum says Oh, sure! I'm fascinated by humor. Finn hands her the comic and she puts on her glasses to read it. Hmm! Yes. Certainly what this hirsute gentleman needs is a tetanus shot. Excellent point, Finn."
1035,"Finn says No, but... is it funny? Never mind."
1036,"Princess Bubblegum says I don't have time to explain the psychology of humor to you. She picks up a baseball bat, smashes the front window of a nearby bookstore, and takes a book. But I'd like you to read this book."
1037,"Kenneth says Emerging from the bookstore Hey, what do you think you're - Oh! Princess Bubblegum! Bubblegum hands him the bat. Thank you, Princess."
1038,"Princess Bubblegum says Der Witz Und Seine Beziehung Zum Unterbewussten. ""The Joke and his Relation to the Unconscious"". It's printed in Gebrochene Schrift, which I think is easier on the eyes."
1039,The scene changes. Finn is walking through the forest with the book.
1040,"Finn says ""Der Witz Und... Der Witz Und... See-einy... Bezeyhung... Zumbewuzzzz..."" Ugh! PB's too smart. That's why she doesn't get my joke. I mean... it's funny. He sits on a tree root and takes out the comic. It's funny. ""Ouch, hey this isn't-"" Chuckles ""This isn't helping."" Snickers Uh, it's super funny. Turbo-nerds like PB just aren't the right audience for this sort of thing, you know? I should show this to normal people, the common folk. The busy woman on the go. The regular Joe or Josephine. Or somebody like Ice King, who's desperate for my approval."
1041,"The scene changes to the Ice Kingdom, where Ice King is reading the comic."
1042,"Ice King says Laughing Finn, this is so funny! A kitty with big teeth?! Come on!"
1043,"Finn says Chuckles Yeah, I didn't draw that, but cool. Well, thanks for-"
1044,"Ice King says Oh, yeah. But, uh, what if - and I'm just spitballin'. What if it was something more like, ""Hey, Doc! I got a caveman in my teeth!"" Huh?"
1045,A group of penguins quack in approval of the joke.
1046,Ice King says Haha! Whoo!
1047,"Finn says Heh. Yeah. That's pretty good, I guess."
1048,"Ice King says Oh, is this Ble? I love Ble! That one with the two cops who are always accidentally arresting each other."
1049,"Finn says Right?! And ""Animal Quackers""!"
1050,"Ice King says I've been mailing them my short stories and comics for as long as I can remember. But, uh, nary a piece published. Nary a piece. Suddenly angry. Nary a piece! I hate Ble! Sittin' in their ivory towers! They don't know comedy! They don't understand the common folk! The busy woman on the go!"
1051,Ice King and Finn says Together The average Joe or Josephine! Right!
1052,"Ice King says See? We got the goods, you and I, and they've lost their touch. Hey, if we want them to touch our goods, we should go down there and confront them face-to-face."
1053,"Finn says And if I get my winning caption printed, everybody will know it's funny! I'm talking about you, BMO. But, uh, where do they print Ble?"
1054,"Ice King says Oh, yeah. I don't, uh... Oh! Oh! Yeah, hold this. I'll use my... demonic wishing eye!"
1055,The two of them are transported to a strange dimension with fluffy clouds and rainbows.
1056,"Wishy says Hello, Ice King."
1057,"Ice King says Hello, Wishy!"
1058,Wishy says What do you like to wish for?
1059,Ice King says I wish to go to Ble!
1060,"Wishy says You go, girl!"
1061,Wishy fires a beam of magic at Finn and Ice King. They scream as they are transported to the Ble headquarters.
1062,Finn says Whoa. Why don't you just use that thing all the time?
1063,"Ice King says Oh, it takes a piece of your soul each time you use it. But look! The legendary Bledquarters!"
1064,"Finn says It must be so fun to work here, just sittin' around, making up jokes all day."
1065,They approach the bridge leading to the front door.
1066,Pudding Troll says Hey! Hey.
1067,Finn says Aww. Who are you?
1068,"Pudding Troll says I'm a pudding troll, and I guard this humor magazine."
1069,"Finn says Uhhhh, why?"
1070,Pudding Troll says It's... my job.
1071,Finn says Why is this your job?
1072,Pudding Troll says I... applied? I'm maybe not following you. I think I better escort you off the premises.
1073,"Finn says No! No, no, no. We just want to pitch a cartoon caption!"
1074,"Pudding Troll says Speaking to the second face on his belly. Hey, Big Tina, it's your time to shine, okay?"
1075,The Pudding Troll shoots a blast of pudding at Finn and Ice King. They both scream. Finn pushes back against the pudding but is swept off his feet.
1076,Finn says Waahh!
1077,Ice King is rapidly trying to eat the pudding as Finn washes up beside him.
1078,"Finn says Okay, what's our plan here?"
1079,"Ice King says Maybe if we eat all this ammo, he'll be forced to make more for us."
1080,Finn says Wait. You can fly!
1081,"Pudding Troll says Uh-oh! Angle up, Big Tina!"
1082,Ice King is carrying Finn through the air. He laughs before being taken out by a blast of pudding. Finn falls towards the Pudding Troll.
1083,Pudding Troll says Uh-oh! Ugh!
1084,Finn tackles the Pudding Troll to the ground and pins him.
1085,"Pudding Troll says You win. Fine. I've never let anyone inside before, so I hope you have an amazing pitch."
1086,The Pudding Troll opens the front door and a pile of letters spills out onto the street.
1087,Ice King says Hey! These are all my submissions! They kept them in a big pile by the door... Seems like a good sign!
1088,They enter the building. Dozens of long-dead skeletons are sat at the desks and strewn across the floor.
1089,"Finn says Well, shoot, man. Looks like everyone here is crazy dead."
1090,"Pudding Troll says I've been guarding dead people for five hundred years. Wow, I need to sit with that."
1091,"Finn says This means that Ble Magazine is dead, too! He sits on a skeletons lap at one of the desks. Now how am I supposed to prove my caption's funny."
1092,Ice King says Ding dong! I found Ble 217! We can see what the winning caption was.
1093,"Finn says Reading ""I'm going to write you a prescription for one giant club."" Scoffs"
1094,Ice King says It's about time us young guns took the reins.
1095,"Ice King throws a monitor out the window then blows on a conch shell. The sound reaches the Ice Kingdom, where a large group of penguins hear it and make their way to the Ble headquarters, quacking as they go. They burst through the front door of the building, scattering Ice King's submissions."
1096,"Ice King says Hello, boys. Now let's roll these presses one last time."
1097,"A montage plays. The penguins are seen working at desks and helping to organise Ice King's submissions. Finn and the Pudding Troll work on new comics. Finn draws ""Hat Dog"" and adds a second hat, which they are both satisfied with. The penguins operate the presses, and with a hiss, the new issue of the magazine is produced. Finn staples the spine."
1098,Finn says Our very own Ble Magazine.
1099,"Ice King says And it's a pretty good issue, too. We got that nice cover you did, my short story, ""Fionna and Cake says Baby Detectives"", some, looks like, pudding jokes..."
1100,Pudding Troll says Big Tina wrote those!
1101,"Ice King says ...""Fionna and Cake says Baby Detectives Go to College"", and, of course, your caption!"
1102,Finn says Wow. It looks amazing in print.
1103,"Pudding Troll says Guys, I'm gonna be honest, just speaking as an average Josephine, I really don't get that caption."
1104,Finn says Maybe it doesn't matter if my caption is funny or not. I think I just wanted to be part of Ble. It's something I've been a fan of for so long. And maybe we can bring it back. There's no reason it can't have a new dawn. A Blennaissance!
1105,"Ice King says Okay, boys, close her down!"
1106,"The penguins begin violently destroying all the computers and presses, and set fire to the building."
1107,"Finn says Shouting over the destruction No, you're right. Can't be nostalgic!"
1108,The scene changes. Finn is walking back towards the Tree Fort.
1109,"Finn says Man, that caption was amazing in my head. Maybe I'm not a very funny person. Like, I got low comedy stats. That's kind of a bummer."
1110,"BMO is in the treasure room, humming to himself and drawing a picture on the side of Neptr. Finn enters."
1111,"Finn says Yo, BMO. Check it out! I got Ble to publish my caption, even though I don't need you to think I'm funny anymo-"
1112,"Finn comedically slips on four banana peels in a row, slides across the room screaming, rips his pants, trips over a pile of treasure, flies through the air, and slams face first into the massage chair, which tips over and activates while Finn is stuck upside down in his underwear. BMO and Neptr both laugh uncontrollably. Finn smiles."
1113,"The episode opens at Joshua and Margaret's old office, picking up where The First Investigation ended. Finn and Clock Bear are stood outside, and Finn is on the phone."
1114,"Finn says Hey, Kim Kil Whan. We solved the mystery of the haunted office. It was Clockbear the whole time... Yeah, uh, Jake's around here somewhere."
1115,Jake is in the alleyway around the back of the house.
1116,"Jake says Man, it's crazy to think I was born here. In this alley. Popped right out of my dad's head for some reason. Jake suddenly notices that Warren Ampersand is standing right next to him. Yaah! You scared me there, what with the appearing out of thin air and staring at me all creepy and now you're just reaching towards me."
1117,Warren Ampersand touches Jake's shoulder. Jake turns blue.
1118,"Warren Ampersand says Coughs Let's go, son. Laughs menacingly as he shapeshifts in preparation to create a portal."
1119,Jake says Son? I ain't nobody's son but Joshua and Margaret! Though it is weird that you got exactly the same stretchy power as me.
1120,"Warren Ampersand says Laughs It's not weird. It's fate! We have to leave, like - He shoots out a bunch of lasers which form a portal right now!"
1121,"Jake says Wait, can Finn come with us? We're kind of a package deal."
1122,"Warren Ampersand says Oh, that's kind of a bad idea. Our home world's atmosphere is, uh, poisonous to his kind."
1123,Jake says Well then I'd better write him a note. He takes out a pen and some paper and writes a note.
1124,Warren Ampersand says Destiny calls!
1125,Jake says Whoa!
1126,"Warren grabs Jake and pulls him through the portal. Jake drops the note onto the ground, leaving it behind as the portal closes."
1127,Finn says From off screen Jake?
1128,The scene changes. Jake and Warren are flying through the portal together.
1129,"Jake says Who are you, anyway?"
1130,Warren Ampersand says My name is Warren Ampersand. I'm your alien bio-dad! Heh-heh. He sweats slightly as he laughs.
1131,Jake says Why do you keep laughing?
1132,Warren Ampersand says Laughs I'm nervous.
1133,Jake and Warren emerge out the other end of the portal onto Nerraw.
1134,Warren Ampersand says Laughs and then grunts and coughs as they land. Welcome to your home planet - Nerraw.
1135,"Jake says Great fantasy sci-fi vibe, man. And that black hole really adds an extra dimension to the place."
1136,"Warren Ampersand says Years ago, I left this beautiful planet and traveled to Ooo to implant my destiny-rich, stretchy DNA into a compatible host."
1137,"Jake says That explains a lot, actually."
1138,Warren Ampersand says But now I'm dying.
1139,Jake says What?
1140,Warren Ampersand says I used the last of my strength coughs to bring you home.
1141,"The scene changes. Jake and Warren are walking through the ""city"" on Nerraw."
1142,Alien says Gasps He's here!
1143,Jake says Huh?
1144,Aliens says Gasping and whispering indistinctly to each other. Is that Jake? It's really him! Did you see him? Look over there. Look. That's Jake!
1145,"Jake says Warren, how does everyone know me?"
1146,Warren Ampersand says Because you're the most important person to have ever lived. Behold! The Jakeseum!
1147,They enter the museum.
1148,Jake says A museum? All about me?!
1149,Aliens says Gasping It's Jake! Jake! Jake! It's Jake!
1150,Alien 1 says Will you sign my prophecy book?
1151,Alien 2 says Will you sign my pretzel?
1152,"Jake says This is wild. But it feels so right, you know? Gasps when he notices some pictures on the wall Hey! It's my fifth birthday party. And my graduation. And when I put a snail in my mouth. And when a snail put me in its mouth. And... The final picture depicts Jake fighting a monster No. I don't remember this one."
1153,"Warren Ampersand says Laughs That's an artist's interpretation of the great prophecy. Tomorrow, you are prophesied to battle Ixcano, a monster with tentacles stretching across the galaxy to strangle everything. You alone can banish him to the darkness."
1154,The scene changes. Warren and Jake are walking outside again.
1155,"Warren Ampersand says I've researched your world and created the ideal child room. See? They enter a bedroom. Space stuff, dinosaurs, and cowboys."
1156,"Jake says Cool. But you know it's a little late to try connecting with me, right? Gasps Is that clown cake for me? He shrinks himself and excitedly begins eating the cake."
1157,"Warren Ampersand says Chuckles I got you something else, too. He holds up a wrapped present."
1158,"Jake gasps, unwraps the present, and gasps again. It's a belt inscribed with the words ""Galaxy Saviour""."
1159,Warren Ampersand says What do you think of your old dad's present?
1160,"Jake says Wearing the belt I love it! Still never gonna call you dad, though."
1161,"Warren Ampersand says Oh, I wouldn't dream of asking. But I hope you don't mind if I still wear this. He is wearing a matching belt inscribed with ""Proud Pop""."
1162,"Scene changes. Warren and Jake are walking through a cheering crowd of aliens towards a door, wearing their belts. Jake blows kisses at the crowd."
1163,"Aliens says Cheering Good luck, Jake! Savior us!"
1164,Warren Ampersand says Laughs This is the Sacred Temple of Pannishment. The temple door can only be unlocked by a stretchy dog.
1165,Jake says With key ha-a-a-a-a... He trails off as he sees the door Uh...
1166,"Warren Ampersand says Beyond this door, there lies an ancient, awesome weapon called the Panzark."
1167,Jake says I am so ready for this. This must be why I can stretch.
1168,"Warren Ampersand says Yeah, that totally tracks."
1169,Jake says Hup!
1170,"Jake enters the complicated series of tubes on the front of the door, laughing and grunting as he fills them with his body. The belts begin to glow."
1171,Jake says Struggling This is so complicated and rewarding.
1172,"Warren Ampersand says You're doing great, son!"
1173,Jake says Almost there. Grunting
1174,Aliens says Chanting Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake!
1175,"Jake sighs with relief as he reaches the top of the door. The door creaks and swings open. The crowd cheers, and Jake laughs weakly."
1176,Warren Ampersand says The Panzark!
1177,"Jake says Grunting, he picks up the Panzark and carries it outside. Yay!"
1178,Scene changes to night. Jake is lying in the bedroom. He looks decrepit and old.
1179,Jake says Moans Saving the galaxy's exhausting. I'm dying... for a soft pretzel with mustard. Groans
1180,"Jake flops onto the floor and slithers like a pancake towards a curtained doorway that reads ""private""."
1181,"Jake says Reading ""Pri-tzels""! Oh. ""Pri-vate""."
1182,"Warren Ampersand says From behind curtain Hello, there, you handsome young devil. Have we met? Jake slithers through the curtain and sees Warren talking to himself in a mirror. Oh wait, it's just me! I didn't recognize this smooth, young skin or these vigorous kneecaps."
1183,"Jake withdraws from the room quietly, a little creeped out. The scene changes to daytime. Jake is snoring in his bed, and is suddenly awoken by Warren energetically placing a lap tray on top of him."
1184,Jake says Oof!
1185,"Warren Ampersand says Removing lid from the lap tray It's another clown cake, with a side of cocktail hot dogs."
1186,"Jake says Dude, weren't you, like, dying?"
1187,"Warren Ampersand says Ignoring him Shush, son! He bats the clown cake to the floor and points out the window. Ixcano approacheth!"
1188,There is a rumbling and growling as tentacles appear on the horizon. There is screaming as they begin to grab aliens.
1189,"Jake says Oh, dang."
1190,Warren Ampersand says I'll go grab the Panzark.
1191,"Warren smashes out the side of the building with great energy, carrying Jake and the Panzark. He places them both down."
1192,Jake says So how do I-
1193,Warren Ampersand says You just gotta stretch through the convolutions of the Panzark to activate its kill beam.
1194,"Jake says More stretching, huh? He grunts as he enters the Panzark. Here comes the hero."
1195,"Warren Ampersand says Stretch, baby! Stretch!"
1196,Jake continues to stretch through the tubes of the Panzark. His belt glows brightly. The Panzark lights up and fires a beam at Ixcano. The aliens cheer.
1197,"Warren Ampersand says You're doing it, son!"
1198,Jake says Ugh. This is too much.
1199,More lasers are fired at Ixcano as Jake struggles through the tubes. He tires out and the tube he's in shatters. The Panzark deactivates.
1200,Warren Ampersand says Jake!
1201,Aliens says Jake! Jake! Ja-
1202,"The aliens suddenly stop cheering and recede into the ground. Ixcano disappears back over the horizon. The Panzark also collapses and recedes into the ground. Jake is left withered and aged, lying on the ground."
1203,Jake says What's going on? Where's that Ixcano jerk?
1204,Warren Ampersand says I have a confession. There is no Ixcano. I made it all up.
1205,Jake says So... you're not really dying?
1206,"Warren Ampersand says No, I was dying. I needed to siphon your precious stretchy essence to keep me young and virile. I use these belts as a conduit. The more you stretch, the stronger I grow! I've done it hundreds of times, to hundreds of sons. He demonstrates by stretching his palm to show himself draining energy from a set of other figures. But I never felt guilty before. Maybe it's because you're so much cooler than my other kids."
1207,"Jake says Well, I am cool."
1208,"Warren Ampersand says Or maybe it's this feeling your kind calls... low-key affection? I- I low-key affection you, son. He kisses Jake on the head."
1209,"Jake says I'm sorry, Dad. Begins crying I wasn't powerful enough to destroy Ixcano! Sobbing"
1210,Warren Ampersand says What? No. It was just me stretching the whole time. The Panzark. The people.
1211,Jake says You're just saying that to make me feel better.
1212,"Warren Ampersand says I'll prove it. He shapeshifts to resemble Finn. ""I'm Finn! I like pizza and dangerous girls."" And here's Joshua! He extends a new appendage and shapeshifts it to resemble Joshua. ""I'm no Warren Ampersand, but I guess I raised you."""
1213,Jake says Chuckles Do more!
1214,"Warren Ampersand says Creates Lady Rainicorn. ""I'm Lady! Neigh."" Oh, I know. You like parties! Creates a bunch of party bears. Here's a bunch of party bears!"
1215,Jake says Laughs Make more party bears! And make the tree house! Put party bears on the tree house! Put party bears in the sky!
1216,Warren Ampersand says Chuckles weakly Okay.
1217,"Warren fulfils each of Jake's requests as he lists them. He begins to noticeably age, while Jake is slowly restored."
1218,"Jake says Keep stretching, you old phoney. It only makes me stronger! He stands up, revealing that he has switched the belts."
1219,Warren Ampersand says Belt switch! But how?!
1220,"Jake says Old-fashioned grifting, ya rube!"
1221,"In a flashback, Jake is shown switching the belts while Warren was distracted by his crying. The flashback ends."
1222,Jake says My real dad taught me that trick.
1223,Warren Ampersand says But I was a proud pop!
1224,Jake says I'm the proud pop of a whole bunch of pups. The belt totally applies to me as well. He shapeshifts to look like a photograph of his children. See?
1225,Warren Ampersand says Five stretchy pups.
1226,Jake says Whuh-oh.
1227,"Warren Ampersand says You saved me after all! He tries to open a portal, but he doesn't have the energy. Out of juice. I need those pups!"
1228,Jake says Don't even think about it!
1229,"Warren boards a tiny rocket ship. The whole of Nerraw is sucked up into the ship, leaving behind only a barren asteroid, the clown cake, and some cocktail sausages."
1230,Warren Ampersand says Can't wait to meet my grandkids and drain their essence. The rocket takes off.
1231,"Jake says Aw, nah! He grabs the rocket out of the sky. Leave my kids alone! He moves the rocket towards the black hole."
1232,"Warren Ampersand says If you destroy me, you'll be stuck on that rock forever!"
1233,Jake says My pups are worth it! He throws the rocket into the black hole.
1234,"Warren Ampersand says Not the singularity! I just wanted to live forever! He leaps out of the rocket as it gets spaghettified and looks at the black hole below him. I see now. This fleshy form has taken me as far as it can. I'm going 4-D, baby. He is spaghettified."
1235,"Jake says Bye, Warren Ampersand. Thanks for reminding me what it means to be a good dad He reverts to his normal yellow color. by being the worst dad ever. Never even got a pretzel."
1236,The episode opens with Finn carrying two plastic bags full of eggs towards the Tree Fort.
1237,"Finn says Grunts as he opens the door with his foot, then opens the fridge with his foot and begins pouring in the eggs. Boiled eggs. In the fridge."
1238,Jermaine is sat at the table. He clears his throat. Finn bangs his head on the fridge door and scatters boiled eggs over the floor.
1239,Finn says Jake! You're back! I've missed you so mu- Oh.
1240,"Jermaine says Uh, hi Finn. It's just me."
1241,Finn says Jermaine! You and Jake both have sort of a grapefruit nature to you.
1242,Jermaine says I came to your playhouse because I'm worried about Jake.
1243,"Finn says Don't worry, he's fine. He left a note."
1244,"Finn holds up Jake's note. It reads ""BRB - Jake""."
1245,Jermaine says How long ago did he leave that?
1246,"Finn says Uh, I dunno. Maybe five weeks?"
1247,"Jermaine says Groans and exhales sharply Whoo. Finn, you know you can call me if you're in trouble, right? Our brother's missing, and I come here finding you doing a lazy man's load with a hundred boiled eggs."
1248,Finn says It's all they have at the store.
1249,"Jermaine says Sits on the floor I'm just worried, 'cause I had a dream about Jake - a vision."
1250,"A representation of Jermaine's vision is shown. A tiny Jake is shown on top of Jermaine's head. He is in space, emaciated and alone."
1251,"Jermaine says I think he's all alone in outer space. I don't think he can come home, and he's running out of birthday cake and cocktail hot dogs."
1252,Jake falls onto his side and the vision ends.
1253,Finn says Jake's in space?!
1254,Jermaine says Brushing something off his head I know! It's chilling.
1255,"Finn says Hmm. Oh! So, this cosmic stuff, planets and space... He begins writing a note. A pen lid in his mouth muffles his speech. This is Normal Man-type subjects. He spits out the lid and slaps the note onto the fridge alongside Jake's. It reads ""BRB - Finn"". We're going to Mars!"
1256,"Jermaine says Mars?! Grunts and gets up. Is it too much to hope that ""Mars"" is the name of some bookstore you like?"
1257,The scene changes. Finn and Jermaine approach the house where Normal Man used to live.
1258,Jermaine says Is that a boat? I haven't seen a boat in years.
1259,They enter the house. Tiny Manticore is sat on a shelf listening to a cassette player.
1260,"Jermaine says Ah, this is a pretty old house. What's that on the shelf? A little pegasus?"
1261,They continue into the basement.
1262,Jermaine says Into the basement. Sure is lots of broken glass and decay down here. I'll be honest - I was just talking a lot because I'm nervous.
1263,Finn says Grabs the handles of the Martian transporter. I know.
1264,"Finn gestures to Jermaine, and Jermaine climbs onto his chest."
1265,Finn says Whispering Jake.
1266,The transporter whirs to life and sends them both out of the atmosphere in a beam of light. They pass through a cluster of eggs in space and then touch down on Mars. Jermaine screams the entire way.
1267,"Jermaine says Whimpers, panting, coughs, then speaks hoarsely Mars."
1268,Finn and Jermaine walk past some Martians cleaning statues of Margles.
1269,Finn says Dang. Looking real prosperous around here.
1270,"Jermaine says Who's the statues, do you think?"
1271,Finn says Maybe Margles? But I've only seen a photo of her. Wait! Betty?
1272,Betty is standing by a pile of sand and a huge hole. She uses a pair of tweezers to drop a grain of sand into the hole.
1273,"Betty says Oh, Finn. Uh, how is-"
1274,"Finn says I haven't seen you, Betty, since you double-crossed everyone."
1275,Betty says I-
1276,Finn says Ya slopped up!
1277,King Man says Finn! Empathy! He climbs out from the pile of sand.
1278,Finn says Normal Man.
1279,"King Man says Nay! King Man! Bows and then puts his hand on Finn's shoulder. Finn, Betty is tormented. Just look at her."
1280,Finn says Oh.
1281,Betty says I'm trying to get better. I'm filling this hole with sand - grain by grain. She drops another grain into the hole.
1282,King Man says We're going to cure Betty's obsession with the Ice King and the magical madness inflicted upon her.
1283,Betty says Glitches out. G-G-G-G-Gah
1284,"Finn says If you inflicted it on her, shouldn't you be filling the hole?"
1285,"King Man says Empathy, Finn. He noogies Finn."
1286,Finn says Aah!
1287,"The scene changes. Finn, Jermaine, King Man, and Betty are walking down a canyon towards a large entranceway."
1288,"King Man says Okay, so, Jake's in space."
1289,Jermaine says Yeah.
1290,King Man says And you don't know where in space.
1291,Jermaine says Yeah.
1292,"King Man says And you don't know where in space, even though literally every single place in this dimension is air quotes ""in space""."
1293,"Jermaine says Again, yeah."
1294,"King Man says You are a real cutie. Okay, here we are. To locate Jake, you will need to retrieve our space telemetry capsule - deep within Mars at the end of a deadly three-part mind maze."
1295,Jermaine says Whimpers
1296,"King Man says Don't fret, cowardly dog. Betty will go with you."
1297,Betty says I... should really get back to my sand.
1298,Finn says Nah. You should come with us.
1299,"King Man says Now, only Martians may enter the maze, so you'll need hats to fool the guard over there."
1300,"Jermaine says Okay, cool. Where are the hats?"
1301,King Man says Space.
1302,"Jermaine says Wha- Aw, come on, man!"
1303,King Man winks and points to a nearby box full of hats.
1304,Jermaine says Groans
1305,"Finn removes his normal hat to put on a Martian one, revealing that his head is shaven."
1306,Jermaine says Eeh!
1307,"Finn says Talking to the guard. Um, Door Man?"
1308,Guard Man says Looking up from his book I'm Guard Man.
1309,"Finn says Well, I am Boy Man."
1310,"Jermaine says Uh, and I'm... Jer Man."
1311,Guard Man says Sure. Looks back down at his book.
1312,"Finn says Whispering to Jermaine ""Jer Man"" was really funny."
1313,"Jermaine says Thanks, Finn."
1314,They enter the maze and the door slams shut. They emerge into a room filled with water and strange frogs. Most of them have heads which resemble Ice King's crown.
1315,"Finn says Hey Jermaine, get a load of these frogs. What do you think's going on with all these frogs, Jermaine? Jermaine?"
1316,Jermaine says What? I don't know.
1317,Finn spots a single frog whose head resembles Fern's hat.
1318,"Finn says Oh, whoa. That one looks different - kinda... special."
1319,The Fern frog's eyes suddenly turn red. It hisses and leaps at Finn.
1320,Finn says Yip! He ducks the frog.
1321,Fern frog says Remember!
1322,The frog falls into the water and out of sight.
1323,Finn says Whew!
1324,Betty says Finn!
1325,"Finn says I'm okay. These guys mean business, though. If you look them in the eyes, they get outraged."
1326,"As Finn is speaking, Betty looks at many of the Ice King frogs, and their eyes turn red."
1327,"Finn says You got all that, Betty? Betty! Hup!"
1328,Finn tackles Betty to the ground and the frogs fly overhead.
1329,Betty says Oh! There's more on this side.
1330,Finn says Growls Hyup!
1331,Finn hoists Betty and Jermaine onto his back and runs to the end of the room as frogs continue to fly at them.
1332,"Betty says Guys, I think I figured out the frog puzzle. Jermaine pulls her hat over her mouth, and her speech is muffled. It's really quite simple."
1333,"They arrive at a structure made of ice where there is a blackboard full of mathematical symbols, and the Ice Thing is perched above."
1334,"Betty says I found the next challenge! I think maybe if I solve this equation, we'll be able to pass through to the next chamber."
1335,"Finn says And if we mess up, that guy pecks our tummies open, right? He gestures at the Ice Thing."
1336,"Betty says No. See, the work is already full of errors. I just need to correct them."
1337,"Jermaine says Um, I'm not trying to complain or anything, but none of these puzzles have anything... to do with... me."
1338,Betty says Speaking over Jermaine Look see? This quadrinomial has been improperly factored. He forgot to double cube root the bottom partial nominator. She magically produces a piece of icy chalk and corrects the error on the blackboard. There we go. I'll have us out of here in no time.
1339,"Finn says Well, just let me know if you need any help - with anything besides these maths problems."
1340,"Betty says Muttering to herself X plus square, hypotenuse cubed plus Y minus three... Muttering continues."
1341,Finn spots the error she corrected reverting back to its erroneous form.
1342,Finn says Gasps
1343,Ice Thing says Chuckles
1344,Finn says Hey! He's jukin' the stats!
1345,Betty says What?
1346,Finn says He's changing the dang numbers around!
1347,Betty says He's changing. Oh no.
1348,"Finn says Climbing towards the Ice Thing Come on, Jermaine!"
1349,Jermaine says Up there? You're gonna break your neck!
1350,Ice Thing says Laughs and takes off.
1351,Finn says Hey!
1352,"The ice structure snaps and Finn falls through the blackboard, screaming. It shatters and Finn, Jermaine, and Betty are transported to a white void."
1353,"Finn says Groans and rubs his head If anyone else feels like solving any of these puzzles, just jump right in, you know?"
1354,Jermaine says Hey! Over here! I hear something.
1355,They approach a window which looks into a room where a past version of Betty is speaking to someone on the phone.
1356,Past Betty says ...if you water them once a week they'll totally be fine. No! I know! Six months studying ancient petroglyphs in the Outback?! Squeals I can't believe it! Her conversation continues indistinctly in the background.
1357,Betty says That's me.
1358,Jermaine says Uh-doy!
1359,Finn says You looks so happy. And sane.
1360,"Betty says Sighs I was. But I never took that trip. I met Simon the next day, and he was just so amazing. I put everything on hold to help him search for the Enchiridion."
1361,"Jermaine says Listen, Betty, I may not be a psychiatrist or a life coach, or even know what you're talking about, but maybe you should try focusing on yourself a little more, you know?"
1362,"Betty says Can I though? I spent so much time dedicated to Simon I'm not sure there's even any ""me"" left anymore."
1363,"Past Betty says Good point, Future Betty! Maybe it is too late to save you, but with your power and my joie de vivre-ay, maybe the two of us could save Simon together! Think about it."
1364,"Finn says Oh, come on, Betty! Get it together! Even if you are a lost cause, she-"
1365,Jermaine says -Or whatever she represents-
1366,Finn says -is not.
1367,Past Betty says Or am I? Blinks innocently
1368,"Betty says No, Finn's right. You'll thank me for this later, Past Betty."
1369,"She magically changes the date on Past Betty's plane ticket so that it says ""today"" instead of ""next week""."
1370,Past Betty says Hmph.
1371,The room dissolves into static and then returns with Past Betty preparing to leave for her trip.
1372,"Past Betty says Speaking on the phone And don't forget to water my plants. Okay, got to go! My flight leaves in an hour!"
1373,"She hangs up, and the room dissipates. There is a pop, and confetti falls from above into the white void."
1374,"Finn says Good job, Betty."
1375,"Betty says Thanks, Finn. Sorry I couldn't be more help. I was a little preoccupied."
1376,Jermaine says Oh really?
1377,"Finn says Anyway, where's the space thingy? Chanting Space thingy! Space thingy!"
1378,Jake says Space what-y?
1379,Finn and Jermaine says Jake!
1380,Jake says Hey everybody.
1381,"Finn says Hey, long time no see, brudda! Scratches Jake's head."
1382,"Jake says Laughs Hey, what's with the hair, brudda?"
1383,"Finn says Man, you're lucky you missed it. I had lice crazy-bad! I think I got them from Marceline, who got them from Ice King."
1384,"While Finn is talking, Jermaine, in horror, flashes back to all the times throughout the day where he has touched Finn's head."
1385,Jake says Laughs Nice.
1386,"Finn says Anyway, how'd you even get here?"
1387,Jermaine says Eugggh! Drops the hats he is holding.
1388,"Jake says Beats me. I was just eating a sausage on some stupid planet, then all of a sudden there was a beautiful rainbow explosion and a loud noise - sort of like a space telemetry capsule activating. Then here I was, standing next to this Mars door."
1389,"An opening has appeared in the void, and King Man is standing on the other side of it, back in the canyon where they began. King Man blows a party horn as Finn, Jake, Betty, and Jermaine exit the maze."
1390,"King Man says Congratulations, everybody. Now, who's ready for a nice boiled egg?"
1391,Finn says Me!
1392,Jake says Me!
1393,Jermaine says Wait a minute. What even happened in there? Where's the telemetry capsule?
1394,"King Man says Don't you see, Jermaine? You were inside the capsule all along, learning valuable lessons while you programmed its Jake-extracting telemetry with your minds."
1395,Jermaine says Of course.
1396,"King Man says And you, Betty - finally you've learned that most pressing of lessons - that sometimes, for our own good, we must accept the loss of that which we hold most dear."
1397,Betty says Imitates a buzzer I've learned that I just got to work even harder to get it back.
1398,King Man says What?!
1399,"Betty says Like, did you see Finn in there? He was indomitable!"
1400,King Man says Yeah I guess but-
1401,"Betty says So as I stared into that endless white void, I came up with a plan."
1402,King Man says A plan?
1403,"Betty says For me, to save my Simon, and for you, we fade to black and an image of GOLB fades into view to finally pull Margles GOLB then turns to the viewer as our view accelerates towards its mouth back from the maw of GOLB."
1404,King Man says Gulps Marg-
1405,The episode opens with Princess Bubblegum flying the Morrow over Gumbaldia. Starchy is hanging from the underside of the Morrow with a camera.
1406,"Princess Bubblegum says Okay, Starchy. Now!"
1407,Starchy says I'm on it! Do I - Do I just pull this lever? A roll of film is ejected out the back of the camera. No! He pulls out some replacement film and closes the camera again. I'm on it.
1408,"Starchy begins to photograph the city. The photographs show weapons and military parades. Scene changes to a darkroom in the Candy Kingdom, where Princess Bubblegum is developing the photographs."
1409,Princess Bubblegum says Excellent. These photos will help us find out what sort of forces Gumbald has amassed before we mobilize our troops.
1410,"Colonel Candy Corn says What's that, dear?"
1411,Princess Bubblegum says These photos will help us find out - She is interrupted by Colonel Candy Corn.
1412,Colonel Candy Corn says I'm glad there's going to be another proper war before I kick the bucket. Wipe 'em out!
1413,"Princess Bubblegum nods. Suddenly, Finn opens the door to the darkroom."
1414,"Finn says Hey, Princess."
1415,Princess Bubblegum gasps. The light causes the photograph she's working on to fade.
1416,"Princess Bubblegum says Finn, you donked up my recon!"
1417,Finn says I've got some important stuff to say. He inhales deeply. I don't think going to war with your uncle is a good idea.
1418,"Princess Bubblegum says I don't have any choice. By building an army, he's forcing my hand."
1419,Finn says It seems to me that all these rhubarbs down through history don't do nobody no good.
1420,"Princess Bubblegum says Throwing away the ruined photograph as well as her gloves and apron Finn, we all love how sweet you are, but sometimes we just have to buckle down and do things the ugly way. Excuse me. She exits."
1421,"Colonel Candy Corn says It's gonna happen, son. Best thing to do is sharpen your sword and stock up on flower wreaths. He exits."
1422,"Finn says You're dark, Colonel Candy Corn."
1423,Finn follows Colonel Candy Corn out of the darkroom. Jake is waiting on a couch just outside.
1424,Jake says How'd it go?
1425,Finn says No good. PB is on the road to war.
1426,"The two of them walk along a corridor together and watch through the windows at the Candy Kingdom making preparations for war. A metal helmet is lowered over the head of one of the Gumball Guardians using a pulley system, overseen by Princess Bubblegum. The guardian taps the helmet and gives a thumbs up."
1427,"Finn says Jake, it's up to us to fix things with Uncle Gumbald."
1428,Jake says Didn't he try to kill you with monsters made out of your own baby teeth?
1429,They watch two armored banana guards sparring outside.
1430,Banana Guard 1 says Take that banana face!
1431,"Banana Guard 2 says Uncertainly Uh, take this, you banana face."
1432,Finn says Does everyone have to get caught up in this mentality? I'm going to march right over to Gumbaldia on a last-ditch diplomatic mission. Want to come?
1433,"Jake says Excitedly Do I? He climbs onto Finn's head and shape-shifts to look like Finn's hat. This is cute, right?"
1434,Finn says You bet! And that's the number one priority for kick-butt diplomacy - the cuteness offensive!
1435,The scene changes. Finn approaches Gumbaldia with Jake still stretched over his head.
1436,"Finn says Hey, this is kinda backwards, right?"
1437,Jake says How so?
1438,"Finn says I used to be all about violence. Now it's, like, I'm different."
1439,Jake says You're a beautiful flower and I love to watch you grow.
1440,Finn hums to himself as he reaches the entrance to the ziggurat at the center of Gumbaldia.
1441,Unknown voice says Halt!
1442,Finn says Gumbald?
1443,"Jake stretches out his arms and points Finn's head in the direction of the entrance, and clicks his tongue. The Green Knight emerges from the shadows, menacingly."
1444,Green Knight says None shall pass.
1445,Finn says Growling Fern.
1446,Jake says Whispering to Finn Cuteness offensive. He clicks his tongue again.
1447,Finn says Sighs Okay. Calling out to the Green Knight. I don't wanna fight! I'm just here to see your boss.
1448,The Green Knight approaches
1449,"Finn says Fern, I know we have beef, but let's just talk. I didn't even know you were alive."
1450,Green Knight says Scoffs You thought you had beaten me? He shapes his arm into a blade. Me?!
1451,Finn draws the Night Sword and they begin to duel.
1452,Green Knight says Cool sword.
1453,Lolly is seen viewing the fight from a balcony.
1454,"Finn says Fern, stop!"
1455,"The Green Knight draws his axe and Finn backflips out of the way as it comes crashing down, then blocks a follow-up attack."
1456,"Green Knight says I used to want to be you. Now I'm a better you! He opens his helmet, revealing Fern's face. I've proved it. There's nothing you have that I don't."
1457,"Jake rams Fern with his shapeshifting powers, sending him flying."
1458,"Jake says Retracting back over Finn's face Bark! Bark, bark, bark, bark! Bark, bark, baraaaah!"
1459,Lolly says Boys! Boys! She walks out onto the terrace above the fighting. Stop all this roughhousing!
1460,"Fern says Sighs Yes, Aunt Lolly."
1461,"Finn says ""Aunt Lolly"" - she sounds kind of like mom, yeah?"
1462,Fern says Hey! She was my mom too!
1463,"Finn says I know, man. We're like family. So why are we fighting?"
1464,"Fern looks away and covers his face again with a sigh, before returning into the darkness."
1465,Lolly says Walking down the steps to meet Finn and Jake Sorry about him. Now what's a sweet boy like you doing here?
1466,"Finn says I'm trying to stop this ridiculous war. I mean, this whole thing is crazy, right?"
1467,"Lolly says Between you and me, honey, I don't want war either."
1468,Scene changes. Lolly leads Finn down a corridor.
1469,"Lolly says Gumbald is becoming so paranoid and erratic. All he talks about is baking that wretched, wretched cake. Maybe you can talk some sense into him."
1470,Finn says Did you say he's baking a cake?
1471,"Lolly opens the door into a room where Chicle is painting a portrait of Gumbald. Gumbald himself is sat on a horse, modelling for the portrait."
1472,Chicle says Aah! A breach! Running away But my secret plan is to never die!
1473,"Gumbald says So, it begins. He taps a button on his wrist and an alarm starts blaring."
1474,Finn says Wait! I'm a diplomacy boy today!
1475,Lolly says Gumbald! He's just here to talk. She takes his wrist and turns off the alarm.
1476,Gumbald says Snatching away his wrist Traitor!
1477,Lolly says I think we can trust him.
1478,"Lolly begins whispering indistinctly into Gumbald's ear, glancing back at Finn and Jake. Jake idly messes around with his shapeshifting abilities while they whisper, taking the form of various hats on Finn's head."
1479,Finn says Whispering to Jake Stop.
1480,"Gumbald says To Finn I'll hear your case boy, but I've got a busy day. We'll have to walk and talk."
1481,Gumbald dismounts from the horse. Lolly gives Finn an uncertain thumbs up. The scene changes to Gumbald leading Finn down another corridor.
1482,"Finn says Look, PB doesn't want to attack you. You're gum from the same sidewalk. Like, just look at this bomb secret laboratory over here. This is exactly the kind of thing PB would have."
1483,"Gumbald says Slams the door to the laboratory so that Finn can't see inside, and holds up photographs of the Candy Kingdom's war preparations. Then why is she building up her arms? He scatters the photos at Finn's feet. He points at his arm. You see this? This is her forcing my hand. He grabs his wrist and moves it back and forth."
1484,Finn says But that's exactly what she's saying. You're both so unreasonable.
1485,"Gumbald says You want unreasonable? Get a load of my unreasonably bad boy battle automaton! Her name is The Cake. He gestures up at The Cake, which fills the chamber they are now standing in. My niece would never have the ambition for a project like this. But ambition is my whole deal! You want a closer look, boy? I grant it to you."
1486,"Finn, Jake, and Gumbald board a platform and it begins to carry them upwards."
1487,Gumbald says This magnificent dessert shall make the whole war relatively swift and painless.
1488,Finn says So there's truly nothing I can say to change your mind?
1489,"Gumbald says Princess Bubblegum has made her bed, and now she must lie in it. But not get back up because she'll be dead. Laughs evilly."
1490,Finn says I was wrong about you. You're nothing like Bonnie.
1491,Gumbald says Wait. She'll have her cake and eat it too - because she'll be dead! The Cake makes her dead!
1492,There is a thud and the platform lurches. Finn and Gumbald both cry out.
1493,Gumbald says What the -
1494,"One of the ropes snaps and Finn and Gumbald are both thrown off the platform, screaming. Jake, who is still on Finn's head, latches onto the platform while Finn falls."
1495,"Gumbald says No! No, no, no, no, no! Aah!"
1496,"Finn catches Gumbald, and Jake slowly lowers them both to the ground by Finn's neck."
1497,"Finn says Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. The pain is astonishing."
1498,Gumbald says You could have let me die and saved your princess a lot of trouble. Maybe there is a way to co-exist after all.
1499,Finn says Looking straight ahead. Hey-o. That's what I like to hear. Sorry. I'm worried if I turn my neck my head might snap off.
1500,"All three laugh. The Green Knight is shown perched above the chamber. The scene changes. Finn and Jake are eating a banquet with Gumbald, Lolly, and Chicle. Jake is still on Finn's head. They are all laughing together."
1501,"Finn says So Jake is literally inside me, controlling my body and I'm standing in front of my girlfriend's entire family."
1502,Gumbald says Apparently engrossed in the story No!
1503,Finn says This is my first ever girlfriend. I really want her to like me.
1504,Jake says So then I made him do a diaper baby dance! Laughs
1505,Everyone except Finn joins the laughter.
1506,Chicle says You're as funny as me - the funny one!
1507,"Finn says Thanks, Chicle. But, if I could get serious for a second -"
1508,"Gumbald says No need, Finn. Your example has said more than words ever could. Chicle, fetch the celebration bucket. I declare all hostilities between Gumbaldia and the Candy Kingdom ended. He presses a button on his wrist and confetti falls from the ceiling."
1509,Finn says Yeah!
1510,Jake says Whoo-hoo!
1511,Chicle says Celebration bucket! He throws a bucket of glittery pink liquid over Finn and Jake.
1512,Gumbald says Be sure to give Bonnie a big hug from me when you tell her.
1513,Finn says You guys are goofballs.
1514,Jake says Shaking himself off. Blblblblbl!
1515,"As the liquid is scattered over the room, Gumbald and Lolly stand up suddenly and shield themselves with their cloaks. Chicle doesn't manage to find shelter and is splashed by the liquid."
1516,Chicle says Gasps Don't look at me! He runs to an adjacent room and slams the door. Pink smoke poofs out from underneath. Everyone else is silent for a second.
1517,Lolly says Now there's a guy who - who really cares about his hair!
1518,"Finn and Jake says Together Oh, cousin Chicle!"
1519,"Jake says Man, I almost thought that was something really serious."
1520,"The scene changes back to the Candy Kingdom. It is evening, and Princess Bubblegum is holding a peace treaty while she talks to Finn and Jake."
1521,"Princess Bubblegum says I don't believe it. A signed peace treaty? Finn, you're amazing. I could hug you right no- ...Did you stop at a craft store on the way here?"
1522,"Finn says Oh, the glitter juice. It's part of a weird Gumbaldia treaty-signing ritual. Once I got to know him, your uncle was actually pretty cool. As I get older, I see the most important thing is to empathize with my friends and enemies. Like, co-exist instead of cutting off people's heads and stuff."
1523,"While Finn is talking, Peppermint Butler produces a towel and dries the liquid off Finn and Jake. Some of it gets on him, and in a puff of pink smoke he is transformed into a baby."
1524,Peppermint Butler says Squeaks
1525,Princess Bubblegum says Peps?
1526,Peppermint Butler says Cooing and dancing
1527,Princess Bubblegum says Sniffs You've been doused with Gumbald's dumdum solution! Growls and then yells out Gumbald!
1528,"This is seen by the squirrel from a nearby tree, who exits the scene."
1529,Finn says Where are you going!?
1530,Princess Bubblegum angrily ascends a nearby tower and begins cranking a siren.
1531,"Princess Bubblegum says Yelling Candy citizens, we are going to war!"
1532,"The candy people below begin screaming. In a panic, they begin to arm themselves and file out of the castle."
1533,"Colonel Candy Corn says Hoopty hoo, hoopty hey! Let's cut 'em up, folks. Laughs"
1534,Finn and Jake watch the candy people from a balcony.
1535,Finn says I donked up.
1536,The scene changes. The squirrel approaches Gumbaldia. The Green Knight guards the entrance.
1537,Green Knight says Don't halt. Continue running. I command it.
1538,"Inside, Gumbald is addressing a gathering."
1539,Gumbald says My thanks to you all for joining me here today. I hope you're enjoying the hors d'oeuvres.
1540,Squirrel says Whispers indistinctly in Gumbald's ear.
1541,Gumbald says It seems that the Princess avoided our attempt at a peaceful resolution. But it was still a good plan... Aunt Lolly.
1542,"A flashback to an earlier part of the episode occurs, when Finn and Gumbald were on the platform."
1543,Gumbald says This magnificent dessert shall make the whole war relatively swift and painless.
1544,Lolly is shown lurking above the platform with an axe to cut the rope. The flashback ends.
1545,"Lolly says Eh, I love to plan."
1546,Crunchy says Hey. What's a plan?
1547,"Gumbald says Oh, cousin Chicle, you've still got it. Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to unleash plan B. My formidable legion of Candy Kingdom haters. Ricardio, Bandit Princess, Samantha the warrior dog, Peacemaster, Me-Mow, Pete Sassafrass, Ash the Warlock, Sir Slicer, Scorcher, the Green Knight, and finally, the Iced King."
1548,Each character is shown as Gumbald lists them.
1549,"Ice King says Uh, I think I might be here by mistake. What are we doing again?"
1550,Gunter draws a knife.
1551,Gumbald says It's Gum War!
1552,"Outside a very tall Tree Fort, Shermy and Beth are lying on the grass and beatboxing."
1553,"Shermy says Haha, you're doing it wrong. Like this. beatboxes"
1554,"Beth says blows raspberry Shermy, this is silly as heck. Beatboxing is for babies."
1555,"Shermy says robotic voice No, it's not. I am a man."
1556,"Beth says I don't know about that, but you should start thinking about your future."
1557,Shermy fakes a heart attack and falls on his back into the grass.
1558,"Shermy says What about you, Princess Zip? What are your goals?"
1559,Princess Zip says Speaks alien language
1560,Shermy says Ha! Princess Zip's got a one-track mind!
1561,The ground starts to shake. A Prize Ball Guardian is seen in the distance guarded by a futuristic flying Banana Guard.
1562,Shermy says Prize Ball Guardian's back!
1563,"Princess Zip flies away in a hurry, shooting off into the distance, akin to a rocket."
1564,Shermy says Let's get 'em!
1565,Shermy and Beth run closer to the Prize Ball Guardian.
1566,Shermy says Get that boulder!
1567,Beth teleports the boulder closer to them using her bellybutton.
1568,Shermy says Hup! Whap!
1569,Shermy ties a rope between the boulder and a tree.
1570,Shermy says Ha! Here it comes!
1571,"The Prize Ball Guardian walks between the tree and the boulder. Its foot gets stuck for a second, but the rope becomes untied and the Prize Ball Guardian keeps on walking."
1572,Shermy says laughs Boy! My knots suck!
1573,"The flying Banana Guard, grasping its weapon, turns around and faces Shermy."
1574,"Shermy says Yeah, I see you."
1575,"Beth says Hey, Sherm, you see this?"
1576,Shermy says Nope.
1577,Beth says It looks like the Guardian scuffed something up.
1578,In the footprint left by the Prize Ball Guardian is an old metal prosthetic arm.
1579,Shermy says Ohhh! picking it up Whoa!
1580,"Beth says It's beautiful! Let's take it home, and I'll learn about it with my brain."
1581,Shermy says You and your brain!
1582,Scene cuts to Shermy and Beth walking into a cave and entering their house.
1583,"Shermy says Singing ♪ ""On a tropical island, on a tropical island..."" ♪"
1584,"Shermy says It looks so old, Beth! Whose do you think it is... or was?"
1585,Beth says There's no markings on it or anything. I think we should find the King of Ooo and ask him.
1586,"Shermy says What? Beth, the King of Ooo is just a myth... Come on, Beth!"
1587,"Beth says That's what I thought, too, but I was doing some research at the library–"
1588,Shermy says Nooooo! Not the library! You can't make me!
1589,"Beth says Shermy, I have the book here. Already checked it out."
1590,Shermy says Oh.
1591,Beth says He's supposed to have lived in a cave at the top of Mount Cragdor.
1592,Shermy says Really?
1593,Beth says Uh-huh... He's supposed to have lived forever.
1594,Scene cuts to Shermy and Beth walking up a mountain.
1595,"Shermy says Come on, Beth! Come on, come on, come on!"
1596,"Shermy jumps into Beth's bellybutton, teleporting him farther up the path."
1597,"Shermy says Come on, Beth! Come on, come on, come on!"
1598,They reach the top of the mountain.
1599,Shermy says I did it. I found him! The King of Ooo.
1600,"BMO says Welcome, friends, I've been expecting you. Because of my proximity radar. Hehehe... Come on inside."
1601,"Shermy says Wow! King of Ooo, you must be rich!"
1602,"BMO says Yeah, that's me alright."
1603,BMO says I'm sure you are very thirsty after your journ...something shatters in the room
1604,Shermy says Whoops...
1605,Shermy says This place is wild. Shermy runs into AMO's old body Huh? This is crazy!
1606,BMO says Please be careful with...something snaps in the room
1607,"Beth says Sorry, sir... My big feet."
1608,"Shermy says Hey, Beth, look. I'm a princess, too more things fall and break"
1609,Beth says Shermy...
1610,Shermy says I-I think it's okay... BMO leaves the scene slowly
1611,Beth says Be careful... This stuff isn't ours. Woops. Oh... a door cracks open and the wintery wind flows into the room
1612,"BMO says Well, goodbye!"
1613,"Beth says Oh, no, no..."
1614,BMO says Have fun on the other side of this door.
1615,Beth says But... We came here to ask about something.
1616,"BMO says No, don't worry about it. Please leav... Beth touches BMO's head with Finn's bionic arm"
1617,Beth says BMO takes his crown and fake beard out and picks the arm up Do you recognize it?
1618,BMO says Yeah... It belonged to my best friend. Fred!
1619,Shermy says Fred!
1620,"BMO says No... Not Fred... His name was, Phil! He was an amazing hero, and he was there at the end."
1621,BMO says Do you know about The Great Gumwar?
1622,Shermy says Mnm-mnm.
1623,"BMO says Well, get ready to have your hair blown back!"
1624,"Flashback to Finn and Jake, sitting atop of a cliff. Finn stares at King man, Betty and Maja who are on top of a flying carpet."
1625,"Finn says Hey, there it is again! It's close."
1626,Jake says Let me see!
1627,"Finn says Watching through binoculars It looks like Normal Man, Betty, and... enhancing Maja?"
1628,Jake says trying to get the binocular Come on!
1629,"Finn says Hey, just-"
1630,"Jake says Let me- grunts, sees through binocular Maja's got smoke coming off her."
1631,Finn says You think they're with the Gumbaldians?
1632,"Jake says I don't know, but they're flippin' freakin' me out. Normal Man, Betty, and Maja disappear. Guess we better tell PB, huh?"
1633,"Finn says Sighs Yeah, I guess."
1634,"Jake says Hey man, don't even worry about all this war stuff. I know we'll find a way to fix this thing. Come on! You'll see. Stretches, taking Finn and heading toward the Candy Kingdom."
1635,"BMO narrating says And so the Princess was mother to her own uncle, and that made him mad. But she had friends, and he had friends, so they decided to have a bad fight - the biggest fight that Ooo had ever seen."
1636,"Princess Bubblegum says Then it's settled. At the stroke of high noon, when the sun is at its most zenith-est, Banana Battalions three and four will initiate operation ""Shut the Door"", forming a pincer formation around Gumbald's exposed nether legions, isolating his rear and -"
1637,"Duke of Nuts says Um, excuse me? Excuse me. Princess, if I may. I think I have a plan that'll put an end to all this tonight. I just need a Bowie knife, a snowmobile, a parachute,  rubber gloves, and, uh... interrupted by Lemongrab"
1638,"Lemongrab says Grunts Terrible, mm! Terrible plan!... Mm! No!"
1639,"Duke of Nuts says But, but my -"
1640,Lemongrab says My plan! Hot air balloon!
1641,"Princess Bubblegum says Hey! Now's not the time. Unless we win this fight today, we all get to take a nice Pep-Butt-style sponge bath in Uncle Gumbald's extra-strength lobotomy sauce, understand? Peppermint Butler, now a baby, stumbles in front of her and falls off the table."
1642,Lemongrab says No.
1643,Duke of Nuts says Not really.
1644,"Princess Bubblegum says Well I do, so we're doing this my way. Now-"
1645,"Finn says Um, PB?"
1646,"Princess Bubblegum says Finn, you're back. How goes the scouting?"
1647,Finn says Um-
1648,"Jake says We saw Normal Man and Betty flying around with Maja, and they were chanting."
1649,"Princess Bubblegum says Hmm, very peculiar."
1650,"Finn says Hey, maybe this is, like, a bad omen. Like, to see the King of Mars, um, up among the stars? It's like a bad omen, and you should call off the battle. I think I heard that somewhere..."
1651,"Some beeps catch Finn and Princess Bubblegum's attention. A cake person, outside their tent, is spying them with a camera."
1652,Camera says Low battery. Please connect to power...
1653,"Huntress Wizard shoots an arrow near the cake person, and she grunts to him."
1654,Cake Person says Gasps Long live Gumbaldia!
1655,"The cake person runs away and Huntress Wizard chases after him. Soon, the cake person shrieks, terrifying Finn."
1656,"Princess Bubblegum says Stonk! That dang Gumbald just peeped all my tactics! Grunts, smashing the camera He's left me no choice. The attack begins now."
1657,"Cut to the tent where Gumbald, who is watching the recording, and his allies are."
1658,Princess Bubblegum in video says Stonk! That dang Gumbald just peeped all my tactics! Video is paused
1659,"Gumbald says Well, that settles it then. If we know, and she knows, and we know she knows we know - which we do - then we know we have no choice. We must strike now. Ladies and gentlemen, to war!"
1660,"It's dawn and Banana Guards are hurrying to the battlefield. Marceline descends from top and levitates in front of Princess Bubblegum, who is testing her war horn while walking, not noticed. She bumps into Marceline's feet, and she looks up at Marceline"
1661,Marceline says A word?
1662,"Princess Bubblegum says All right, just make it quick. ...Please."
1663,"Marceline says Well, I know you're under a lot of pressure here, but I... I just wanna ask you to reconsider. I mean, I don't like to flaunt my suffering cred, but I've lived through something like this once before, and... cut to a flashback of child Marceline picking Hambo during the Mushroom War, facing some burning buildings I'm just not really tryin' to help start that all up again."
1664,"Princess Bubblegum says I understand, Marceline, I really do. But I just can't see another way out of this. Look, I've gotta go. walking away Let's talk more when this is all over. Wish me luck, okay?"
1665,Marceline says Good luck!
1666,"Jake says to Finn What if PB's right about this? Maybe she'll just go whup Gumbald's rear, and then things'll go back to normal."
1667,"Finn says Nah, man, she's wrong. This is all wrong. Even if she wins now, this is never gonna end; I can feel it. It's like the whole world's going crazy, man, like we're living in, one, big... turns around and checking his pack"
1668,Jake says Finn?
1669,Finn says takes out the Nightmare Juice given by Nightmare Princess... one big nightmare.
1670,Sun rises; cuts to the troop of Banana Guards with Lumpy Space Princess before them.
1671,Lumpy Space Princess says Here we go.
1672,Colonel Candy Corn says Watches Huntress Wizard as a bird form flying; turns back War! War! War! War! War! War!
1673,"Princess Bubblegum says Banana Guard 500s, you're on!"
1674,"A nearby wooden crate collapses, revealing an armed and advanced Banana Guard inside."
1675,"Banana Guard 500 says Up we go. Ascends with a rocket, so do more Banana Guard 500s. In position, ma'am. Code name, ""Father's Brother"", appears testy."
1676,"Gumbald says laughs inside The Cake More bananas!? You're weird, Bubblegum! walks back to the panel behind; to a cake person You! Give me your lunch. Got a banana in here? finds a lemon Is this a banana? Hey, niece!"
1677,"Gumbald tosses the lemon to the ground, blasting it with a giant laser beam with a candle, while other cake people around runs away before then when spotting this. Seeing this, Lemongrab, next to Princess Bubblegum, writes a note and pass it her."
1678,"Princess Bubblegum says Yes? reads the note, reading ""UN-MAKE ME"", ""L."" Groans and then steps on some banana guards I'm doing it! I'm soundin' the war horn! War horn blares"
1679,Finn says Wait!
1680,"Princess Bubblegum says What!? The horn stops. Dang it, Finn!"
1681,"Finn says PB! He sees that you're serious! Maybe he'll back down now. Please listen to me! We've been friends for a long time. in her's view, a montage of Shoko, with her robot arm, is shown."
1682,"Princess Bubblegum says frowns Okay, Finn. We'll give him one last chance."
1683,The Cake walks a few steps towards and stops.
1684,"Gumbald says What? with a telescope, seeing Princess Bubblegum, Jake, and Finn, who is waving with his hat. Come on."
1685,Finn says Here they come!
1686,Gumbald says Hurry this up. I want a war.
1687,"Finn says Hey, Fern."
1688,"The Green Knight, with his grass armor popples, gives no response."
1689,"Princess Bubblegum says Uncle Gumbald, I demand that you de-escalate your forces now."
1690,"Gumbald says Chuckles Listen to yourself. You're a toddler, Bonnibel."
1691,Princess Bubblegum says Gasps SURRENDER OR DIE!
1692,Gumbald says No!
1693,Jake says That's my cue!
1694,Princess Bubblegum says What?
1695,Jake says Hya-pow! Hops and throw the Nightmare Juice to the ground.
1696,"The bottle shatters, and a light purple fog is unleashed, surrounding them and making them unconscious."
1697,Lumpy Space Princess says Screams They're dead! They're actually dead!
1698,Cut to the unconscious world.
1699,"BMO narrating says And so they were dead. ...No, not dead."
1700,Princess Bubblegum says What is this place? Finn?
1701,"Finn says Last resort! Sorry, PB, but you were acting like total nuts out there. Now you guys have to hash this out in the unconscious world."
1702,Gumbald says This is... a dream?
1703,"Jake says Yeah, man. You can basically do anything in dreams."
1704,"Jake closes his eyes and a sandwich pops up in his right hand, and he starts to eat it. Seeing this, the Green Knight turns back into Fern."
1705,"Gumbald says Sneak attack! brings a mace into existense; Fern does too If we destroy them here, maybe they'll die in the real world."
1706,Princess Bubblegum says Psst! Not if I destroy you first!
1707,"Finn says No! We need love, not war!"
1708,"Princess Bubblegum says Good idea. creates a pink bazooka Love bazooka! Put down your weapons, or I'll bazooka you!"
1709,Gumbald says No!
1710,"A nearby pot shakes and a singing poodle comes out, confusing Gumbald, Fern, and Princess Bubblegum."
1711,Finn says Thank goodness for a singing pot beast to de-escalate the situation.
1712,"The poodle explodes into colorful light, birds and flowers, blinding the rest of people except Gumbald, who starts to run away."
1713,"Jake says Oh, this sandwich is way too much for me. Jermaine always liked splitting sandwiches."
1714,"Jermaine says Comes into existence, taking a bite of the sandwich. Mmm! Thanks, bro."
1715,Gumbald says I'm gonna figure out how to wake myself up and take my revenge on you sleeping chumps!
1716,Fern says You're leaving me?
1717,"Gumbald says You're on your own, kid. Disappears in a chimney."
1718,"Overwhelmed by being abandoned, Fern, staring forward, grows roots to the ground."
1719,"Princess Bubblegum says He's rooting into the ground. Ready, aim..."
1720,"Finn says No! Shoves away the bazooka, which blasts a hole on the wall. You're supposed to be having some kind of epiphany!"
1721,Princess Bubblegum says Lets go of the bazooka. Here's my epiphany says you've gone rogue on me! I'm outtie five thou! Flies away through the hole.
1722,"Finn says Fern! Grunts Come on! Snap out of it, man! More vines grows around Fern. Aah!"
1723,Fern says I don't need your help. Swishes the Grass Sword while a green cocoon wraps him up.
1724,Finn says Jake? Help me!
1725,"Jake says I want to help you, suddenly wearing a waiter suit but I can't lose this job."
1726,"Jermaine says Snaps finger twice Waiter! Oh, waiter!"
1727,Finn says Dude...
1728,"Fern's cocoon breaks, Fern, now a pterodactyl-like monster, screeches and flies into the sky."
1729,"Fern says I'm going to fly around, and wreck things, until I feel better! Or until I tire myself out."
1730,Finn says Peaceful thoughts... Turns himself into a small blue butterfly; flies towards Fern Fern!
1731,"Jermaine says It all looks so good. Fern screeches at Jake and Jermaine, who notices him What's up with that bird? Why are you looking at me, bird? Fern dives in front of them, flying away, with Finn chasing him. Bad bird!"
1732,Jake says Looking Fern trying to fight Finn; sighs Everybody gets an evil doppelganger but me.
1733,Jermaine says I'll be your evil doppelganger!
1734,"Jake says Jermaine, you're the best! Laughs and hugs Jermaine."
1735,Jake and Jermaine run around happily; the scene changing into Princess Bubblegum chasing  a laughing Gumbald.
1736,"Princess Bubblegum says Enough, Gumbald! Both diving into the mouth of a nightmarish Gumball Guardian."
1737,"Gumbald says To a Sandwich Person Pinch me, I want to wake up!"
1738,Princess Bubblegum says Gumbald! We're ending this here.
1739,Gumbald says So be it.
1740,"Both Princess Bubblegum and Gumbald create a toothbrush, engaging in a duel; as they stops, both of them shocks glitchily. Cuts to Finn comforting Fern, who is still screeching."
1741,"Finn says If you could just calm down and be cool, it would be a great thing that there's two of us."
1742,"Fern loses his balance and starts to fall, turning back to original form and screaming, and Finn also turns back and fetches Fern on the ground."
1743,Fern says Why don't you just fight me like a real butterfly!?
1744,Finn says We're two sides of the same coin!
1745,Fern says You'll never understand what it's like to be me. I'm TORMENTED!
1746,Finn says I'm ALSO that sometimes!
1747,"Fern says Prove it, or I'll never stop fighting you."
1748,"Jermaine says Laughs with Jake, and then notices Finn and Fern Oh geez, how's he gonna do that?"
1749,"Jake says Hmm? Notices a Finn-shaped door appears on the wall Finn, we'll be right back."
1750,Finn says Okay- ah! tackled by Fern
1751,"Jake and Jermaine laugh and pass the door together. The screen goes black for few seconds and cuts to a nightmarish Gumbald's Cabin in night, with Princess Bubblegum and Gumbald randomly switching identity with each other."
1752,"Princess Bubblegum says Holding a flask of Dum Dum Juice Come on, little gum. Don't run away from happiness! I'm gonna fix you!"
1753,"Gumbald says No, no, no!"
1754,"Princess Bubblegum says Just ONE drop. Drip a drop, I drip a drop. Not gonna stop, till I drip a drop."
1755,Gumbald says Hmm? blows a bubble containing a pea shooting taser
1756,"Princess Bubblegum says Laughs Drip, drip! The flask is broken by Gumbald, shattered, splashing the juice over her body. She gasps. The juice! NOOOO!... Engulfed by a pink smoke and turned into a pink candy person; chuckles ...Wuh-what?"
1757,Gumbald says picks up Princess Bubblegum's crown and puts it on Call me... princess.
1758,Candy Bonnibel seems not amused. The scene converts through a giant eye on the wall.
1759,Jermaine says What are we looking for?
1760,"Jake says Mm, I can't quite picture it. But I'm pretty sure Finn buried it here."
1761,Jermaine says ... In the underground balloon mall. Remember how much balloon animals used to cheer Finn up?
1762,Jake says Yeah...
1763,"Lady Rainicorn says 그래. ""Yeah."""
1764,Jake says confused Huh?
1765,"Lady, now as Jake's arms, is with him on the planet Ni'Rah, looking Jake."
1766,"Jake says Uh, Lady, where's Jermaine?"
1767,"Lady Rainicorn says 쉿. ""Shh."" leads Jake to a red, hexagonal portal. 이런 어두운 지하굴에서는 살살 걸어야 돼. ""You have to walk carefully in a dark cave like this."""
1768,"The portal opens, zooming to a small carton house with Jake's five pups sleeping inside."
1769,"Jake says Aww, sleepy puppies."
1770,"The pups wake up, staring Jake with blank, black eyes."
1771,Jake says Yee! Steps back in horror
1772,"The pups ascend and turn into vampires, hissing."
1773,Jake says And I'm done!
1774,"Lady Rainicorn says 걱정하지 마, 제이크! 내가 처치할게! ""Don't worry, Jake! I got this!"""
1775,Jake says What? Oof! dragged by Lady and falls down; gasps
1776,"Lady is cooking Charlie, Viola, and Jake Jr. alive, with Kim Kil Whan as a hot dog and T.V. having a tomato stuck into his mouth."
1777,"Charlie says in a distorted voice Your farts aren't funny, dad!"
1778,"Jake says NOOOOOO!!! collapses and weeps on the ground, while his body detaches with Lady, with his rear sniffing around, digging into a rug. Huh? Oh dang! Finn's vault is found underground. Is that... Finn's vault? suddenly, a giant fog of fart erupts from his rear Aargh! Nightmare fart!"
1779,"Candy Bonnibel opens her eyes, and Gumbald, now a princess, stands and ascends on a quickly growing Candy Tree. In a few seconds, Bonnibel can see the whole process of Gumbald's kingdom developing into a flourishing society, pretty identical to the Candy Kingdom."
1780,Candy Bonnibel says Thinking It's beautiful...
1781,"Candy Bonnibel stands in a street, still watching. A silhouette of Gumbald emerges, and the whole candy castle starts to melt down into pile of sticky waste, terrifies Candy People around."
1782,"Gumbald says No! Oh, why didn't I build an armature?"
1783,"Candy Bonnibel says Grunts and struggles to reach Gumbald; thinking I can help you, Princess! Just listen to this! Inhales; in a childish voice Watch me do my tiny taffy dance! She fails to do what she intended and dances, sobbing in a smiley face"
1784,"Gumbald is entertained by the dance and laughs, but then he cries bitterly to the candy ruins and also melts. The light goes out."
1785,"Fern, as a green bear, growls at Finn."
1786,"Finn says Fern, come on! I'm not fighting you."
1787,Finn turns into a blue bear to resist Fern's attack. Suddenly they stop and sniff.
1788,"Finn &amp; Fern says Oh, what reeks?"
1789,"Jake says Repressed memories! Brings the vault from the portal. A note on it reads ""THIS VAULT BELONGS TO FINN AND FERN"""
1790,Finn &amp; Fern says My vault!?
1791,Jake says Proof! Opens the vault.
1792,"Some ghostly, glowing, green figure of their fears come out; Finn and Fern scream. As the figure becomes clear, they are a mix between Grass Demon with Martin Mertens, Princess Bubblegum, Susan Strong, and The Lich, in green flames."
1793,Finn says See? this is our shared torment!
1794,The fears start to fly around like ghosts; Finn and Fern scream again as they revert to their humanoid form.
1795,"Fern says Dude, I blocked this stuff out for a reason!"
1796,"Finn says Speaks painfully Well, now you know how I feel about knowing how you feel about!"
1797,"Fern says Speaks painfully Okay, okay! Just make it stop!"
1798,Finn says We gotta confront them head on!
1799,"The fears retreat back into the vault. Inside, it goes dark again. A pair of blue round lights rotates and disappear; next, a silhouette of a trapped Finn with Grass Demon briefly appears; and finally, the eyes of the Grass Demon glow. Finn and Fern gasp."
1800,Finn says Fern. This is why I brought us here. We can defeat him together.
1801,Fern nods and they both jump into the vault.
1802,Princess Bubblegum's voice In Finn's head says No fear.
1803,"Finn opens his eyes, seeing the Past Finn, in coma, suspended in the air by the web created by Grass Demon, which is now seizing him. Finn climbs up, pulling off the Grass Demon by force and falling to the ground."
1804,Finn says So you're the nasty grass wad that's been holding my Finn boy hostage.
1805,"Grass Demon says Without me, he's got no body. So back off. aims his rear at Finn"
1806,Finn says You sicken me.
1807,"Grass Demon shakes his tentacles, trying to escape, but he is held by Finn and then pierced by Past Finn with a chair. Two Finns high-five. Grass Demon dies and the whole grassy realm decomposes."
1808,"The singing poodle flies in the sky, holding a snake in the mouth and turning back his true form says the Cosmic Owl. Finn and Past Finn, who is without a shirt, are sitting on a small island"
1809,Past Finn says I'm me again. It feels like it's been years.
1810,"A small whale emerges, spit out mini Princess Bubblegum and Gumbald. Princess Bubblegum touches Past Finn's finger, but his finger start to slowly disintegrate. She gasps."
1811,Past Finn says He was right. I've got no body.
1812,"Jake says Ah, don't worry. It's just a dream!"
1813,"Back to the reality, it turns out the whole nightmare takes place within seconds."
1814,"Lumpy Space Princess says Screams They're dead! They're actually dead! They all wake up, and the Green Knight turns back to Fern for real. Never mind! They're okay!"
1815,Finn says Fern! You really are disintegrating!
1816,Jake says My bad.
1817,"Gumbald says Bonnie, I..."
1818,"Princess Bubblegum says I'm so sorry for what I put you through for all those centuries. The Candy Kingdom was your dream, and I took it from you."
1819,"Gumbald says Bonnie, that means so much to me. Come. From now on, we'll live in peace. He walks forward but is tripped by Lolly. The flask of Dum Dum Juice breaks, and as he takes it out, it shatters in his face. Drat."
1820,Princess Bubblegum says WHAT?!
1821,"Gumbald reverts back to the Punch Bowl again, laughing stupidly and running away."
1822,Lolly says He never was the epiphany type. But I am willing to let bygones be bygones.
1823,"Princess Bubblegum says Very well. Two Candy Kingdoms, it is!"
1824,People from Both Sides says Hurray!
1825,"BMO narrating says And so, in the end, they decided not to have the big fight."
1826,"Beth says Oh! So you meant, like, the end of the war. I thought you meant like the end of the world."
1827,"BMO says No, no, no. That happened next."
1828,"Lumpy Space Princess says So I guess everyone's just going home, huh?"
1829,Jake says Yep.
1830,"A hole appears in sky, throwing King Man, in flames, to the ground."
1831,King Man says We donked up for real. faints
1832,Everyone looks up and the hole enlarges. GOLB emerges and slowly descends.
1833,Finn says Jake... what am I lookin' at?
1834,"Jake says Uh... we saved the day. So, maybe that big baby's here to give us presents for doing a good job?"
1835,Dark clouds cover up the sky of Land of Ooo.
1836,"Fern says Okay, I'm not an expert, but this seems bad."
1837,"Flame Princess says You ain't kiddin', shrubs."
1838,Lumpy Space Princess says Oh - no - ! takes a GOLB selfie
1839,Marceline says Bonnie! What did you do?!
1840,Princess Bubblegum says It wasn't me!
1841,"Ice King says To Bandit Princess It's been real cool being in this rogue's gallery with you. Me and Gunter were gonna go, uh... sees GOLB Oh... my... flashback to Simon reading a page about GOLB in the Enchiridion GOLB!"
1842,"Simon Petrikov says Look, Betty. I keep seeing reference to this mysterious entity that embodies chaos."
1843,"Betty Grof says That's great! Come on, let's make sundaes."
1844,Simon says GOLB would say ice cream is without meaning. Just empty calories devoid of purpose.
1845,Betty says Good thing he isn't here then.
1846,Simon says Pours chocolate syrup on his sundae His presence is felt in every crevice where chaos lurks. Imagine if we could somehow harness all that dank energy...!
1847,Betty says Hey! You want some cherries with that chocolate syrup?
1848,Simon says Now there is too much chocolate syrup on the sundae Oh! Chuckles Sure.
1849,Betty says Catch! Throws the jar to Simon.
1850,Simon and Betty are on a rushing ambulance.
1851,Simon says Have you thought about using sliced almonds for the sundaes? Flashback ends
1852,Ice King says Shakes his head ...I don't know who that is!
1853,"GOLB growls in a silent, deep voice. His mouth creates some glowing spiritual tentacles, which capture some Cake people to forge a screeching blue demon."
1854,Lolly says Don't let it touch you!
1855,The demon captures some more Cake people with his tongue.
1856,"Candy Person says No, I'm a loner!"
1857,"Marceline says Peebs, this is the worst thing ever! If somebody doesn't stop this, it could be the end of Ooo!"

1862,Banana Guard says Can we flee in a panic?
1863,Princess Bubblegum says Yes!
1864,"All the Banana Guards run away in disorder, screaming."
1865,"Finn says FYI, Princess, I'm not going anywhere!"
